bevacizumab in combination with various chemotherapy agents eg an anthracycline docetaxel capecitabine or paclitaxel in women with breast cancer and determining that the data indicate that bevacizumab does not prolong overall survival in breast cancer patients or provide a sufficient benefit in slowing disease progression to outweigh the significant risk to patients genentech the manufacturer of avastin bevacizumab disagreed with this assessment and was granted a public hearing on cders withdrawal proposal which took place in june 2011 a final decision to remove the breast cancer indication
