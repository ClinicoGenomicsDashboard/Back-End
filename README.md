# Templating for Clinical Trials Eligibility Criteria
Scripts, data, and clusters used in the process of templating clinical trials eligibility data in order to provide more structure.

## Scripts
Most scripts used for clustering and automatic templating are stored in /scripts/.

## Raw Data
Raw data for both the sample set and full cancer set are stored in /Formatted Data/.

## Clusters

### Sample set
Clusters are stored at /clusters/final340numclusters2/.

### Full cancer set
Clusters are stored at /clusters/final9knumclusters/, ordered clusters at /clusters/ordered9kclusters, clusters of cluster centers at clusters/center9kclusters/, and megaclusters at /clusters/mega9kclust/.

## Templates
Some templates for the full cancer set generated by the program are stored at /templates/templates/ and /templates/fillins/.  Thresholds for the templates shown are noted in /templates/thresholds.  All booleanized templates for the sample set are stored at /templates/booleanizedtemplates/.

## Parser
Code for the parser is stored at /templates/parser/.
