# Back-End
The backend for the symptom-drug linking service, which carries out more complex computations for the front-end. It contains the data gathered, both in raw and formatted form, as well as all scripts used to gather and preprocess this data.  It also contains a deep learning network to predict the correct drug category from vectorized symptom data.
