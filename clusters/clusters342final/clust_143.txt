Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)
White blood cell count >= 4000 cells/mm^3
White blood cell count (WBC) >= 4,000/ml
B-ALL patients must have an initial white blood cell count < 50,000/uL
The following tests must be performed within 42 days prior to registration either for diagnosis/staging or to obtain baseline values:* White blood cells (WBC)* Hemoglobin* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)* Hepatitis B-surface antigen (Ag) and anti-core antibody (Ab)
Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)
White blood cell (WBC) > 3.0
White blood cells (WBC) >= 3,000 cells/uL (3.0 x 10^9 L) or
Total white blood cells (WBC) >= 4.0 x 10^3/mcL within 28 days prior to registration
A total WBC >= 3.1 x 10^3/mcL is allowed for non-Hispanic black males (NHBM) and total WBC >= 3.4 x 10^3/mcL for non-Hispanic black females (NHBF) * Exception: If the WBC is lower than the above levels, the patient may be enrolled IF the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is >= 1.3 for NHBM, >= 1.4 for NHBF, or >= 1.5 for all.
White blood cells (WBC) >= 3500/uL
White blood count >= 3,000/uL, obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization
White blood count >= 3,000/uL
Patients with white blood cell (WBC) > 30,000 are not eligible to start therapy; however, it is permissible to use glucocorticoids and/or hydroxyurea to diminish peripheral WBC to less than 30,000 provided these agents are stopped at least 24 hours prior to the first dose of MLN0128 (TAK-228)
Total absolute phagocyte count (APC = [%neutrophils + %monocytes) x white blood cells [WBC]) is at least 1000/uL
White blood cell count (WBC) >= 2,000/mcL; must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration
White blood cell (WBC) >= 2000/uL
White blood cells >= 2000/uL, within 4 weeks of randomization
Within 28 days prior to administration of study treatment: White blood count (WBC) > 3 x 10^9/L
White blood cell count (WBC) >= 3 x 10^9/L
