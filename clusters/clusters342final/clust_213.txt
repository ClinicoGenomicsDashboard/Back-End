Histologic documentation: newly diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV intracranial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma; GBM with oligodendroglial features are NOT PERMITTED in this study if they are 1p19q codeleted; sites submitting GBM with oligodendroglial features will be asked to provide results of 1p/19q codeletion status
Patients must have pathologically proven squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) cancer of the lung confirmed by tumor biopsy and/or fine-needle aspiration; disease must be stage IV SCCA, or recurrent; the primary diagnosis of SCCA should be established using the current World Health Organization (WHO)/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)-classification of Thoracic Malignancies; the diagnosis is based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides with or without specific defined immunohistochemistry (IHC) characteristic (p40/p63 positive, transcription termination factor [TTF1] negative) if required for diagnosis; mixed histologies are not allowed
Patients must have histologically proven glioblastoma or gliosarcoma which is progressive or recurrent following radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy

Patients must have histologically confirmed high grade glioma by pathology (World Health Organization [WHO] grade III and IV)
World Health Organization (WHO)-defined acute lymphoblastic leukemia and either:* Relapsed after achieving remission* Refractory to therapy* Newly diagnosed and ineligible for intensive chemotherapy inductionNote: patients with T lineage and B lineage ALL are eligible for this trial; likewise, patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) (as long as they are not candidate for other therapies for Ph+) and Ph- ALL are eligible
RECURRENT/ PROGRESSIVE DIPG (STRATUM 1): Patients with progressive DIPG, as defined by progressive neurologic abnormalities or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression (e.g., anticonvulsant or corticosteroid toxicity wean, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, etc.), OR an increase in the bi-dimensional measurement, taking as a reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since diagnosis, OR the appearance of a new tumor lesion since diagnosis* Please note: patients with a radiographically typical DIPG, defined as a tumor with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of more than 2/3 of the pons, are eligible without histologic confirmation* Patients with pontine lesions that do not meet these radiographic criteria will be eligible if there is histologic confirmation of malignant glioma World Health Organization (WHO) II-IV

Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma at initial surgery* Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made (high-grade transformation)
Patients must have histologically-proven GBM
Newly diagnosed patients with CD-22 positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) are eligible; patients with Burkitt type ALL are NOT eligible
