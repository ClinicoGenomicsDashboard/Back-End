Patients with autoimmune disease requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment (and previously ineligible to receive systemic immunotherapies for melanoma) are allowed on condition that they do not receive more than 20 mg of daily dose methylprednisolone, prednisone, or its equivalent; this does not include autoimmune diseases caused by previous immunotherapy treatments for melanoma that require ongoing treatment with corticosteroids (e.g. autoimmune colitis or autoimmune hepatitis receiving corticosteroids)
Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within the past 2 years (i.e., with use of modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment

Patients who received prior pembrolizumab, patients on chronic steroids or who have active autoimmune disease for which they received systemic treatment in the previous 2 years with corticosteroids, disease modifying agents, or immunosuppressive drugs; replacement therapy (thyroxine, insulin or physiological corticosteroid replacement for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is allowed; patients with active interstitial lung disease or who have a history of pneumonitis for which they had received glucocorticoids are not eligible.
Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, immunosuppressive drugs, or corticosteroids with doses higher than prednisone 10mg or equivalent); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment; autoimmune diseases include but are not limited to autoimmune hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Chrons disease), as well as symptomatic disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegeners Granulomatosis]); CNS or motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis or glomerulonephritis); vitiligo, alopecia, hypothyroidism on stable doses of thyroid replacement therapy, psoriasis not requiring systemic therapy within the past 2 years is permitted; short-term steroid premedication for contrast allergy is permitted
Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past two years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment; autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegeners granulomatosis, Sjogrens syndrome, Bells palsy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis
History or evidence of active autoimmune disease (e.g., pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other); or history of active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment (i.e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) within 2 months of enrollment; (replacement therapy [e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency] is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease)* Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as** Primary immunodeficiency state such as severe combined immunodeficiency disease** Concurrent opportunistic infection** Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (> 2 weeks) including oral steroid doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within 2 months prior to enrollment
