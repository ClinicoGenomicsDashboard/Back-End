Patients are allowed prior VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); patients will be stratified based on prior VEGFR-TKI therapy
TREATMENT: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) must have previously been tested for the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, and, if detected, should have received and progressed on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy
Patients must not have a known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion; EGFR/ALK testing is not required prior to registration and is included in the Foundation Medicine Incorporated (FMI) testing for screening/prescreening
Patients must not have received any prior systemic anticancer therapy for advanced or metastatic disease including chemotherapy or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (including gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, or any experimental EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKI] agents); prior chemotherapy for non-metastatic disease (i.e. adjuvant therapy or concurrent chemo-radiotherapy) is allowed as long as > 12 months has passed since completion of therapy; adjuvant EGFR-directed therapy is not allowed; local therapy (i.e. palliative radiotherapy) is allowed as long as a period of 7 days has passed since the last dose was received and the patient has recovered from any associated toxicity at the time of registration
For Dose escalation cohort - progressive disease on at least one prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (previous treatment with 3rd generation EGFR-TKI including AZD9291 allowed for dose escalation)
For Dose Expansion Cohort A: patient must 1) have progression of disease on erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib as last previous systemic treatment, 2) have biopsy of tumor taken after progression on erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib which must be EGFR-T790M negative confirmed by central testing prior to treatment (if EGFR-T790M status is unknown, patients may consent for trial and for biopsy and testing for EGFR T790M will be performed as part of initial biopsy for trial), and 3) be treatment naive to 3rd generation EGFR-TKI (rociletinib, EGFR inhibitor HM61713 [HM61713] and AZD9291) and EGFR monoclonal antibodies
For Dose Expansion Cohort B: patient must 1) have progression of disease on a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI such as AZD9291, rociletinib, HM61713, 2) be treatment naive to an EGFR monoclonal antibody, and 3) have a biopsy of tumor taken after progression on last EGFR-TKI that indicates loss of EGFR-T790M (EGFR-T790M negative) confirmed by central testing prior to treatment (if EGFR-T790M status is unknown, patients may consent for trial and for biopsy, and testing for EGFR T790M will be performed as part of initial biopsy for trial)
For Dose Expansion Cohort C: patient must 1) have progression of disease on a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI such as AZD9291, rociletinib, HM61713, 2) be treatment naive to an EGFR monoclonal antibody, 3) have a biopsy of tumor taken after progression on last EGFR-TKI that indicates preservation of EGFR-T790M post-progression on 3rd generation EGFR-TKI with biopsy confirmation by central testing prior to treatment (if EGFR-T790M status is unknown, patients may consent for trial and for biopsy, and testing for EGFR T790M will be performed as part of initial biopsy for trial
Adequate archival tissue from a biopsy performed after progression of disease on previous EGFR-TKI or willing to consent for a fresh tumor biopsy; (mandatory for Cohorts A, B, C; optional for dose escalation and Cohort D)
Patients must discontinue previous EGFR-TKI at least 7 days prior to study enrollment
Progressive disease on at least one prior EGFR-TKI (previous treatment with 3rd generation EGFR-TKI including osimertinib [AZD9291] allowed for dose escalation only)
Adequate archival tissue from a biopsy performed after progression of disease on previous EGFR-TKI or willing to consent to a fresh tumor biopsy (mandatory for dose expansion cohort only; optional for dose escalation)
For the dose expansion portion ONLY, patient must: 1) have progression of disease with erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib as last previous systemic treatment, 2) tumors must be EGFR T790M negative confirmed by central testing prior to treatment (If EGFR-T790M status is unknown, patient may consent for trial for biopsy and testing for EGFR T790M will be performed as part of the initial biopsy for the trial: patients who test positive for EGFR T790M by central testing will be ineligible for the dose expansion), 3) be treatment naive for 3rd generation EGFR-TKI (CO-1686 and osimertinib [AZD9291]) and mTOR inhibitors
Progression after prior treatment with an EGFR TKI; in addition to this one prior line of therapy, any additional prior lines of therapy are permitted; prior treatment with a third-generation EGFR TKI is allowed for the dose escalation phase, but is not permitted for the expansion cohort
Adequate archival tissue from a biopsy performed after progression of disease on previous EGFR TKI; or willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy prior to registration (for the dose escalation portion only this requirement can be waived if T790M status has already been determined using a local assay)
For the dose expansion portion only, patient must: 1) have a tumor which is EGFR-T790M positive and 2) be treatment naive to T790M-directed EGFR TKI (e.g. AZD9291, rociletinib, etc); T790M testing may be done locally or centrally on study, but if done locally, tissue must be available for central confirmation
Patients must discontinue previous EGFR-TKI at least 7 days prior to study enrollment
The presence of an EGFR T790M mutation after progression on a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI; presence of an EGFR T790M mutation may be documented from biopsy material from any site of disease (intra- or extra-cranial) or from plasma testing if performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory; for patients who have disease progression in the CNS only (with otherwise stable disease systemically), T790M positivity is not required
Disease progression on a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI (i.e. erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib); patient may have also received prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy but this is not required
Prior treatment with a third-generation EGFR TKI (i.e. rociletinib)
Treatment with an EGFR TKI (i.e. erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib) within 8 days or approximately 5 x half-life, whichever is longer, of the first dose of study treatment
