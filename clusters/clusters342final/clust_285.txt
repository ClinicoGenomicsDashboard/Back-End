Negative for hepatitis B, or if infected with hepatitis B, receiving anti-hepatitis B therapy; all participants will be required to be screened for hepatitis B; per Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and Assistance for AIDS Specific Drugs (AASD) guidelines, those participants that show no immunity, defined by the lack of hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection (i.e. hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]+, hepatitis B core [HBcore]+, hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAB]-) will be required to be on anti-hepatitis B therapy during the study in order to be eligible; patients will be permitted to enroll in the study provided normal liver function tests and no evidence of cirrhosis; the exact hepatitis B therapy will be at the discretion of the infection disease specialist or investigator; however all patients who present with acute hepatitis B or show normal transaminases and are hepatitis B virus HBsAg surface protein antigen (HBsAg) positive (+) and immunoglobulin M (IgM)+ for hepatitis core antigen will not be eligible for trial enrollment
