Platelet count > 75,000/uL
The platelet count must be > 75,000 mm^3 prior to starting every cycle of treatment with decitabine; decitabine may be delayed for up to 4 weeks between cycles (i.e. may be administered as infrequently as every (q) 8 weeks) while waiting for counts to recover
Peripheral platelet count (PLT) >= 75,000/mm^3
Platelet count >= 100,000/uL (transfusion independent)
STEP I: Untransfused platelet count >= 75,000 cells/mm^3 (obtained within 28 days prior to randomization)
Platelet count >= 75,000/uL (transfusion independent)
Patients must have a peripheral blast count < 25,000/uL within 2 days prior to registration; (treatment with hydroxyurea and steroids is permitted to bring the countdown)
