NOTE: All patients achieving CR or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) will receive consolidation when fit
NOTE: Patients proceeding to transplant are allowed up to one cycle of consolidation treatment
Consolidation cycle 1 must commence within sixty days of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy that confirmed the presence of a CR or CRi
Patients must have achieved a CR or CRi (or morphologic leukemia-free state for those patients proceeding to Arm G transplant)
Patients who have achieved a CR or CRi must have maintained peripheral blood evidence of a CR or CRi
Maintenance should commence within 60 days of recovery of peripheral blood counts after consolidation cycle 2; patients must begin consolidation cycle 2 within 60 days of recovery to be eligible for further therapy
Patients must have maintained peripheral blood evidence of a remission and must have a CR or CRi, confirmed on restaging bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy and cytogenetic analysis
Patients must be > 28 days from the start of induction or re-induction chemotherapy, or from the start of consolidation cycle 1 (if received) and < 90 days following recovery from most recent treatment; and they must have achieved and maintained a response to induction therapy (CR, CRi, or morphologic disease-free state)
Patients must have achieved a CR or CRi
Patients who have achieved a CR or CRi must have maintained peripheral blood evidence of a CR or CRi
Patients must have maintained peripheral blood evidence of a remission and must have a CR or CRi, confirmed on restaging bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy
CRITERIA FOR MAINTENANCE THERAPY-STEP 4: Patients must have maintained peripheral blood evidence of a remission and must have a CR or CRi, confirmed on restaging BM aspirate and biopsy
COHORT 1 PH-NEGATIVE PATIENTS ONLY: Patients must have achieved CR or CRi within 2 cycles of induction/re-induction with blinatumomab* NOTE: day 1 of post-remission = day 43 of the preceding cycle (+/- 3 days)
COHORT 2 PH-POSITIVE AND PH-LIKE DSMKF PATIENTS ONLY: Newly diagnosed Ph+, newly-diagnosed Ph-like DSMKF, and relapsed/refractory Ph+ patients without prior dasatinib or other 2nd or 3rd generation TKI therapy, must have achieved CR or CRi within 1 cycle of induction with dasatinib/prednisone, or within 2 cycles of re-induction with blinatumomab; relapsed/refractory Ph+ or Ph-like DSMKF patients with prior dasatinib or other 2nd or 3rd generation TKI therapy must have achieved CR or CRi within 2 cycles of re-induction therapy with blinatumomab* NOTE: day 1 of post-remission = day 85 of the preceding induction cycle (+/- 3 days), or day 43 of the preceding re-induction cycle (+/- 3 days) as applicable
Patients must be registered to Step 2 within 28 days after count recovery; (Note: there is no maximum allotted time period for count recovery, providing patient remains in CR or CRi)
AML patients in first complete remission (CR) (CR1) or first complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) after induction and consolidation chemotherapy; except young (< 60 years) AML patients in European LeukemiaNet favorable group; (the current trial will exclude young favorable group AML patients), patients could receive any cycle consolidation or no consolidation per the discretion by the treating physician
NOTE: Patients meeting the following criteria are exempt from the 8 month timeline and do not require additional biopsy:* Patients who have never achieved a complete remission on the last biopsy-proven site of disease and went on to the next therapy then achieved a complete remission* Patients who relapsed quickly (within 3 months of their last chemotherapy) and now have achieved a complete remission with salvage therapy
Patients must have achieved a radiologic complete or partial remission as defined by the Lugano criteria
