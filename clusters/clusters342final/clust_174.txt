Patient with advanced skin cancers
Cytological or histological confirmed diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma that is locally advanced or metastatic and is not amenable to treatment with surgery or to orthotopic liver transplant (Phase II)
First line advanced HCC (i.e., no prior systemic therapy)
Presence of residual or recurrent cancer (locally or metastatic)
For Part I (Arms A, B): Patients can have either locally advanced or metastatic pancreas adenocarcinoma for which no prior therapy has been administered for either locally advanced or metastatic disease; prior adjuvant therapy is permissible if gemcitabine or a fluoropyrimidine was administered with or without radiation and if disease recurrence has been documented at least 6 months after completion of adjuvant therapy
For Part II (Arm C): Patients can have either locally advanced or metastatic pancreas adenocarcinoma; up to two prior treatment regimens are permissible (excluding a prior PARP inhibitor) for either localized or metastatic pancreas adenocarcinoma; prior combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy is permissible provided the patient has measurable disease outside the radiation port; prior therapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to starting study therapy
Patients with locally advanced, previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva
Patients must have metastatic disease or locally advanced unresectable disease
Patients must have either metastatic (stage IVC) or locally advanced unresectable disease (stage IVB)
No locally advanced or metastatic cancer requiring systemic therapy within 5 years prior to registration; no secondary primary lung cancer diagnosed concurrently or within 2 years prior to registration
Metastatic or unresectable locally advanced
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced leiomyosarcoma of the uterus (ULMS); advanced ULMS is defined as metastatic ULMS or unresectable primary ULMS
Must have a histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma (TCC, also known as urothelial carcinoma), locally advanced or metastatic
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced, incurable cancers of the esophagus, liver, stomach, small bowel, pancreas, bile duct, colon or rectum and be eligible to receive chest, abdominal and/or pelvic radiation therapy (RT) for palliation; documentation of this is required in physician note; concomitant systemic therapy is not allowed during administration of palliative RT; palliative RT can be considered for advanced primary tumors or metastatic disease as above
Locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease
Re-registration: locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease
Patients must have a locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma that is either known or suspected to be of gastrointestinal (GI) origin; primary tumors arising from the lung, gynecologic organs or prostate are not permitted
Histologically confirmed non-squamous NSCLC, with incurable advanced or metastatic disease
Locally advanced/unresectable (as determined by local surgeon) OR metastatic disease
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed papillary histology renal cell carcinoma which is metastatic or locally advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection; (NOTE: a designation of type I or type II should be made by the local pathologist if possible); mixed histologies containing type I or type II will be allowed provided that they contain >= 50% of the papillary component
Patients may have received up to one prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma with the exception of another VEGF inhibitor Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for advanced RCC (i.e., pazopanib, bevacizumab, sorafenib or axitinib); if a patient develops metastatic disease within six months of discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, this will constitute one prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC); if a patient develops metastatic disease and more than six months has elapsed since discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, this will not constitute prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic RCC; patients may have also received prior immunotherapy; patients must not have received a MET/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitor or sunitinib as prior therapy; at least 14 days must have elapsed since completion of prior systemic therapy; patients must have recovered from all associated toxicities at the time of registration
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)* Metastatic or locally advanced disease that progressed after at least one prior therapy * Note: patients who have actionable molecular targets (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK], c-ros oncogene 1[ROS1] mutations) must have received (when indicated) prior appropriate targeted therapy using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents
Locally advanced or metastatic disease; locally advanced disease is defined as disease not amenable to local therapy such as surgery and/or radiation
Prior systemic therapy and chemoradiotherapy for treatment of resectable, borderline resectable or locally advanced unresectable disease is allowed and does not count toward prior therapy for metastatic disease
Patients who received systemic therapy with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for resectable or borderline/locally advanced unresectable disease and progressed with metastatic disease within 3 months of the past dose of systemic therapy are eligible
No more than 3 prior systemic treatment regimens for advanced PNET
Patients must have histologically confirmed epithelioid hemangioendothelioma which is metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable)
