Patients are eligible under ONE of the following criteria:* Patients must have histologically confirmed rare cancer and must be able to submit specimens; NOTE: Subsequent to sites Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of revision 3, patients are NOT required to participate in EAY131 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) to register to this study* FOR PATIENTS ENROLLED IN EAY131 NCI-MATCH PRIOR TO EAY131 ADDENDUM 10 ONLY: Patients must have histologically confirmed rare cancer that did not have a match to a molecularly-guided therapy on EAY131 NCI-MATCH protocol or who are off protocol treatment on EAY131, NCI-MATCH and have no further molecularly-matched treatment recommendations per EAY131, NCI-MATCH or who are otherwise unable to receive EAY131, NCI-MATCH therapy
Patient must have enrolled onto APEC1621SC and must have been given a treatment assignment to Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) to APEC1621H based on the presence of an actionable mutation
Patient must have enrolled onto APEC1621SC and must have been given a treatment assignment to Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) to APEC1621F based on the presence of an actionable mutation
Patient must have enrolled onto APEC1621SC and must have been given a treatment assignment to Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) to APEC1621G based on the presence of a BRAF V600 mutation
Patient must have enrolled onto APEC1621SC and must have been given a treatment assignment to Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) to APEC1621C based on the presence of an actionable mutation
Patient must have enrolled onto APEC1621SC and must have been given a treatment assignment to Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) to APEC1621D based on the presence of an actionable mutation; note that treatment assignment may be to primary cohort A for patients with TSC1 or TSC2 loss of function mutations, primary cohort B for patients with other PI3K/MTOR pathway mutations, a histology specific biomarker positive expansion cohort if the criteria to open such a cohort are met, or a biomarker negative expansion cohort if the criteria to open such a cohort are met
Patient must have enrolled onto APEC1621SC and must have been given a treatment assignment to molecular analysis for therapy choice (MATCH) to APEC1621E based on the presence of an actionable mutation* Note: patients with BRAF V600 actionable mutations of interest (aMOIs) will be preferentially assigned to APEC1621G (vemurafenib) if that study is open and they are otherwise eligible for it
