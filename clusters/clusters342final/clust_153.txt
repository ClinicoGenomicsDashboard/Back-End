Estimated creatinine clearance of > 50 ml/min (0.84 mL/s) by the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above ULN as calculated by Cockcroft-Gault
Creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 X institutional ULN and creatinine clearance >= 60 ml/min* NOTE: creatinine clearance must be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Calculated creatinine clearance of > 50 mL/min using Cockcroft Gault equation equation or 24-hour urine sampling
Body surface area (BSA)-normalized creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (using Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance [CrCl])
Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Creatinine clearance >= 51 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Within less than or equal to 14 days prior to registration: Serum creatinine =< 1.5 X institutional ULN and creatinine clearance >= 60 ml/min* NOTE: Creatinine clearance must be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Calculated creatinine clearance >= 45 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equation
