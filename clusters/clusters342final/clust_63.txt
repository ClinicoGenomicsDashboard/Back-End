All patients must provide archival tissue block or paraffin sample from archival tissue block (approximately 10 sections) for use in pharmacodynamic correlative studies (NOT required for patients enrolled on the dose escalation for intermittent ABT-888 portion of the study)
All patients must agree to provide an archival tissue block or paraffin sample from archival tissue block (approximately 10 sections) for use in pharmacodynamic correlative studies; however, patients are not considered ineligible if archival tumor is not available
Patients must consent to analysis on archival tissue; if archival sample is not available, a sufficient tumor biopsy can be performed a minimum of 28 days prior to start of treatment if felt to be clinically reasonable
Patients must have available and be willing to submit baseline tissue taken at the time of disease progression to prior BRAF inhibitor-based therapy (either fresh frozen [preferred], or paraffin-embedded tumor blocks) OR must have a site of disease that can be biopsied within this study for translational medicine studies; tissue may be from an archival biopsy or a new biopsy after the patient has been registered to the protocol; since patients are referred to this protocol after progression on prior BRAF inhibitor-based therapy, the biopsy taken at the time of progression will be used as the baseline biopsy for this study; patients must be willing to submit plasma and whole blood for translational medicine studies
Paired pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies are required for all patients on Part 1 and first 15 patients in Part 2; participants must have available archival tumor tissue (at least 20 unstained slides); if archival tissue is not available or is found not to contain tumor tissue, a fresh biopsy is required; if a patient is having a tumor biopsy, less than 20 unstained slides are acceptable with approval of the principal investigator (PI); biopsies will only be performed in a given patient if they are not deemed to involve unacceptable risk based on the sites of disease and other concurrent medical conditions
Patients must have stage cT2-T4a N0 M0 disease; clinical T stage is based on the transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) sample and imaging studies; patients must undergo cystoscopy and TURBT as part of the staging procedure within 56 days prior to registration; to exclude non-bulky/low-risk tumors and ensure adequate tissue for assessment, subjects must have documented muscle invasion with at least one of the following:* Disease measuring at least 5 mm on cross-sectional imaging or by endoscopic assessment; bladder thickening on imaging without definable tumor is not adequate; pathology verification of >= 0.5 cm of viable tumor (longest diameter) from the biopsy sample and represented on the submitted slides is also acceptable* The presence of tumor-associated hydronephrosis
Patients enrolled in Part 2 must have at least 20 (preferably 40) slides of archival tumor tissue from a prior surgery demonstrating GBM; patients enrolled in Part 1 will not be required to have archival tissue
Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis (a tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required; patients with less archival tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with the MSK principal investigator)
Sufficient tissue and blood must be available to submit for required biology studies
Archival tissue must be available or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STRATUM C: Patients must have adequate pre-trial FFPE tumor material available and be willing to provide a blood sample for use in the genome wide sequencing studies; while tissue is required for genome-wide sequencing of tumor and germline samples, patients will be deemed eligible for the study with a minimum of approximately 10 unstained slides for the planned analysis
Phase II study: measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria; if archival tumor sample is not available tumor sample from fresh biopsy is acceptable
Patients must have access to archival tumor tissue for proposed correlative studies; these may be derived from transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT), cystectomy, or biopsy; if archival tissue is not available for proposed correlatives, patients may be enrolled at the discretion of the study principal investigator (PI) (SKP)
Patients must have tissue available and be willing to submit for independent pathologic review in order to classify type I versus type II papillary disease
Willing to consent to allow access to known archival tumor tissue (NOTE: designated pathologist from participating site OR lead principal investigator must sign-off to ensure sufficient tumor should be available for support of tumor imaging studies [multi-color immunofluorescence])
If archival tumor tissue from a metastatic melanoma lesion is unavailable OR designated pathologist from participating site cannot sign-off to ensure that sufficient tumor is available from existing archival tumor block for support of tumor imaging studies, patients must be willing to consent to undergo a biopsy to collect metastatic tumor tissue; collection of fresh biopsy tissue does not guarantee enrollment, unless the pathologist from the participating site signs-off that sufficient tumor has been collected
Group 2 patients should have archived or fresh tumor tissue available from the non-craniotomy site and will have fresh tumor tissue available from the planned craniotomy
Available pretreatment biopsy, either fresh (optimal) or archival (acceptable)
Patients must be willing and able to undergo a biopsy after signed consent and prior to registration; patients must have tumor tissue and blood samples available and be willing to submit tumor and blood samples; NOTE: core biopsy required; fine needle aspiration (FNA) is not an acceptable substitute for core biopsy
If archival tumor is available for submission, patients must be willing to submit tumor sample
Cohort 1 (NSCLC cohort) * Ability to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for the purpose of screening for this clinical trial (including able and willing to give valid written consent) to ability or to provide an available archival tumor sample taken less than 3 months prior to study enrollment (and not obtained prior to progression on a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk; tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should be the same lesions to be irradiated when possible and should not be the same lesions used as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) target lesions, unless there are no other lesions accessible; additional, optional archival tumor tissue is also requested from before the prior PD-1 directed therapy
Cohort 2 (colorectal cohort) * Ability to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for the purpose of screening for this clinical trial (including able and willing to give valid written consent) to ability or to provide an available archival tumor sample taken less than 3 months prior to study enrollment if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk; tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should be the same lesions to be irradiated when possible and should not be the same lesions used as RECIST target lesions, unless there are no other lesions accessible * Microsatellite stable (MSS) tumor as documented by either: ** Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing that does not suggest loss of MLH-1, MSH-2, PMS2 or MSH6 ** Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that does not suggest microsatellite instability (MSI)
Participants must have archival tumor tissue available for analysis (minimum 20 5 um slide) or be able to undergo a baseline fresh tumor tissue biopsy
Patients must be willing to submit blood and tissue specimens for translational medicine
Willingness to release archival tissue sample for research purposes, if available
Patients must be offered the opportunity to submit archival tissue for translational medicine; patients must also be willing to undergo biopsies and submit fresh tissue and blood for translational medicine
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT ONTO APEC1621SC: Patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample available for MATCH study testing from a biopsy or surgery that was performed at any point after initial tumor recurrence/progression, or be planned to have a procedure to obtain such a sample that is considered to be of potential benefit by the treating clinicians; a tumor sample from a clinically performed diagnostic (pre-treatment) biopsy will be acceptable for enrollment onto pediatric MATCH for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG, brainstem gliomas)
