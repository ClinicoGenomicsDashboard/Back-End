HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or confirmed by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load > 1,000 copies/mL* NOTE: the term licensed refers to a United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved kit or for sites located in countries other than the United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country and validated internally* WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment; a reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load
All participants must be prescribed combination antiretroviral therapy with the goal of virological suppression using an acceptable regimen that adheres to national guidelines for treatment of HIV infection; non-suppressed, treatment experienced patients, defined as patients with a viral load > 400 copies/mL who have been on antiretroviral therapy for more than 4 months can be enrolled if an alternative antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is available that includes at least two ART drugs that, in the opinion of the site investigator, are expected to have activity based on genotypic testing (if available) and treatment history; patients are not allowed to receive zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT]) as part of concurrent chemotherapy and ART regimen, since it is myelosuppressive; zidovudine may be discontinued and substituted as clinically indicated prior to or at the time of enrollment
