Radiation: patients must have:* Had their last fraction of local irradiation to primary tumor >= 12 months prior to registration; investigators are reminded to review potentially eligible cases to avoid confusion with pseudo-progression* Had their last fraction of craniospinal irradiation (> 24 Gy) > 3 months prior to registration
