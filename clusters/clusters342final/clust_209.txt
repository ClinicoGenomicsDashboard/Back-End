Patients with a histological diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma, clinical stage II, III or IV at diagnosis
Patients with a histological diagnosis of clinical stage I epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma
Patients who are currently undergoing treatment (primary or consolidation) for stage II, III or IV ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer or who completed treatment less than six weeks ago
Diagnosis of ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma* Stage II, III, or IV disease with optimal (=< 1 cm residual disease) or suboptimal residual disease* All patients must have a procedure for determining diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, with appropriate tissue for histologic evaluation* The minimum surgery required is an abdominal surgery providing tissue for histologic evaluation and establishing and documenting the primary site and stage, as well as a maximal effort at tumor debulking; if additional surgery was performed, it should have been in accordance with appropriate surgery for ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma described in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Surgical Procedures Manual
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic endometrial cancer; eligible histologies for the experimental cohort are: endometrioid or serous; eligible histologies for the exploratory cohort are: carcinosarcoma, clear cell, mixed, adenosquamous and any other rare sub-type of endometrial cancer
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma; all histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer are eligible, but only patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer will be considered for the statistical analysis; non-high grade serous cancers will be allowed in an exploratory cohort
Patients with the following tumors are included in the study:* Patients initially diagnosed with low-grade serous ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma that recur as low-grade serous carcinoma (invasive micropapillary serous carcinoma or invasive grade I serous carcinomas as defined by GOG, Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [FIGO], World Health Organization [WHO] or Silverberg)* Patients initially diagnosed with serous borderline ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma that recur as low-grade serous carcinoma (invasive micropapillary serous carcinoma or invasive grade I serous carcinomas as defined by GOG, FIGO WHO or Silverberg)
Solid tumor patients in stage 2 must have a diagnosis of papillary serous, endometrioid or clear cell endometrial carcinoma or, high grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid or mucinous ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal carcinoma
Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with documented disease progression (disease not amendable to curative therapy); histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report; NOTE: patients with mucinous histology are NOT eligible; patients with carcinosarcoma histology are NOT eligible
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer and must have a histological diagnosis of either serous or endometrioid cancer based on local histopathological findings; both endometrioid and serous histology should be high-grade for eligibility of non-mutation carriers; patients with clear cell, mixed epithelial, undifferentiated carcinoma, or transitional cell carcinoma histologies are also eligible, provided that the patient has a known deleterious germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation identified through testing at a clinical laboratory* Note: Due to the long acceptance of BRCA testing through Myriad, Myriad testing will be accepted; if testing for BRCA is done by other organizations, documentation from a qualified medical professional (e.g., ovarian cancer specialty physician involved in the field, high risk genetics physician, genetics counselor) listing the mutation and confirming that the laboratory results showed a recognized germ line deleterious BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation or BRCA rearrangement is required; a copy of Myriad or other BRCA mutational analysis (positive or variants of unknown significance [VUS] or negative) reports will be requested but not required for study enrollment
Patients must have clinically and radiographically suspected and previously untreated International Federation of Gynecologic and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III or IV epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, high grade, for whom the plan of management will include neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with interval tumor reductive surgery (TRS) who have undergone biopsies for histologic confirmation
Institutional confirmation of Mullerian epithelial adenocarcinoma on core biopsy (not cytology or fine needle aspiration) or laparoscopic biopsy; (for phase II of the study formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue should be available for laboratory analysis); patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: high grade serous carcinoma, high grade endometrioid carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, or a combination of these
Patients who have received any targeted therapy (including but not limited to vaccines, antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors) or hormonal therapy for management of their epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal primary cancer
Patients with mucinous carcinoma, low grade endometrioid carcinoma, low grade serous carcinoma or carcinosarcoma
Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer, or a past history of primary endometrial cancer, unless all of the following conditions are met: stage not greater than I-A, grade 1 or 2, no more than superficial myometrial invasion, without vascular or lymphatic invasion; no poorly differentiated subtypes, including serous, clear cell or other FIGO grade 3 lesions
Patients who have the following histologies: mucinous, squamous, sarcomas, carcinosarcomas, clear cell
High grade ovarian cancer, including high grade serous; clear cell; endometrioid, grade 3; and others (adenocarcinoma, nitric oxide synthase [NOS]; mixed epithelial carcinoma; undifferentiated carcinoma); NOTE: low grade serous, mucinous and carcinosarcoma histologies are excluded; ovarian cancer = ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer; required data element: submission of pathology report
Patients with predominant (> 30%) non-endometrioid histology (such as serous, clear cell, or carcinosarcoma)
