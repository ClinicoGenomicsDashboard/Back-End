Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
Patients must be able to take oral medications; patients may not have any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of blinded drug (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection)
Patients with impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of ABT-888 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection) are not eligible to participate in this study
Patients must not have a known history of familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease
Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that could interfere with absorption
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral MLN0128 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection that requires nutritional support)
Patients must be able to take oral medications; patients must not have any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of protocol treatment (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection)
Patient must not have prior gastrointestinal (GI) surgery or GI disease that might interfere with the absorption of terameprocol
Patients must not have a history of inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis (history of diverticulosis is allowed)
Active gastrointestinal (GI) conditions that might predispose to drug intolerance or poor drug absorption
Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of study drugs including difficulty swallowing
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
No history of serious digestive and/or absorptive problems, including inflammatory bowel disease and chronic diarrhea that preclude adherence to the study diet
RECURRENT/ PROGRESSIVE DIPG (STRATUM 1): Patients have impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of panobinostat; for example severe inflammatory bowel disease
NON-PROGRESSED DIPG (STRATUM 2): Patients have impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of panobinostat; for example severe inflammatory bowel disease
Active inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., patients requiring current medical interventions or who are symptomatic) or have a history of abdominal surgery or other medical condition that may, in the opinion of the treating physician, interfere with gastrointestinal motility or absorption
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that may significantly alter the absorption of study agent
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of AZD9291 (osimertinib)
Patients with gastrointestinal disease, or those who have had a procedure that is expected to interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of BAL101553 (e.g., functionally-relevant gastrointestinal obstruction, or frequent vomiting unresolved upon anti-emetic supportive care), are ineligible
