History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:
Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease present for more than 3 years prior to screening and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by treating physician
The subject has had evidence within 2 years of the start of study treatment of another malignancy which required systemic treatment
Participants must not have any other concurrent malignancy
Patients must not have another active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers and biochemical relapsed prostate cancer; patients that have completed all necessary therapy and are considered to be at less than 30% risk of relapse are not considered to have an active second malignancy and are eligible for enrollment
For disease specific studies: the subject has had evidence within 2 years of the start of study treatment of another malignancy which required systemic treatment
Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy within 5 years prior to Step 2 registration; if the original histologic proof of malignancy is greater than 5 years, then pathological (i.e., more recent) confirmation is required (e.g., from a systemic metastasis or brain metastasis)
Patients must NOT have previous or concurrent malignancy; exceptions are made for patients who meet any of the following conditions:* Non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or breast cancer in situ OR* Prior malignancy completely excised or removed and patient has been continuously disease free for > 5 years OR* Prior malignancy cured by non-surgical modalities and patient has been continuously disease free for > 5 years
Another active malignancy =< 3 years prior to registration with the exception of non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of any type; NOTE: if there is a history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment for their cancer; any malignancy considered to be indolent and that has never required therapy may allowed at the discretion of the protocol chair
Patient has another concurrent active invasive malignancy
History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:* Non-melanoma skin cancers, non-invasive bladder cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix* Prostate cancer not under active systemic treatment other than hormonal therapy and with documented undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (< 0.2 ng/mL)* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) provided patient has isolated lymphocytosis (Rai stage O), and does not require systemic treatment (for B symptoms, Richters transformation, lymphocyte doubling time [< 6 months], lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly)* Lymphoma of any type of hairy-cell leukemia provided patient is not on active systemic treatment and is in complete remission, as evidenced by PET/CT scans and bone marrow biopsies for at least 3 months* History of malignancy provided that patient has completed therapy and is free of disease for >= 2 years; if patient had other malignancy within the last 2 years from which he may have been completely cured by surgery alone, he may be considered to be enrolled on condition that the risk of development of distant metastatic disease based on American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system is less than 30%
