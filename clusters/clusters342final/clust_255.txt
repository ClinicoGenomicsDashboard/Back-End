Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV or unresectable stage III BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutant melanoma
Patients must have unresectable stage III or stage IV disease
For stage I-III disease, patients should be 2-24 months post-completion of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy with no further planned treatment during the 12-week study and no evidence of disease
For stage IV disease, patients may be receiving no treatment or may be receiving maintenance treatment with a target agent, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy provided the most recent imaging does not demonstrate progressive disease

Patients may not have current dependency on intravenous (IV) hydration or total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
Patients must have pathologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma of the lung with confirmation by immunohistochemistry (e.g., transcription termination factor 1 [TTF-1] positivity) (histologic tissue diagnosis is recommended, but cytology is acceptable); stage IIIA/IIIB or oligometastatic stage IV in which the patient is still considered an appropriate candidate for aggressive chemoradiotherapy for the primary tumor; oligometastatic disease is defined as =< 5 metastatic sites (=< 3 lesions per organ); for intracranial metastasis, the patient should have asymptomatic disease that is stable on steroids or 1 to 3 symptomatic metastatic lesions treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
RMS types included under embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) include those classified in the 1995 International Classification of Rhabdomyosarcoma (ICR) as ERMS (classic, spindle cell, and botryoid variants), which are reclassified in the 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) classification as ERMS (classic, dense and botryoid variants) and spindle cell/sclerosing RMS (encompassing the historical spindle cell ERMS variant and the newly recognized sclerosing RMS variant); classification of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) in the 2013 WHO classification is the same as in the ICR and includes classic and solid variants* ERMS** Stage 1, group III (non-orbit)** Stage 3, group I/II** Stage 2/3, group III** Stage 4, group IV, < 10 years old* ARMS:** Stages 1-3, groups I-III
Stage IV disease
Clinical stage >= T2NxM0 or TanyN+ disease for which radical or partial nephrectomy is planned
Pathologically proven diagnosis of NSCLC, with metastases (stage IV disease) present prior to registration; this includes patients newly diagnosed with metastatic disease or those initially diagnosed and treated for stage I-III NSCLC who ultimately develop metastases.
Prior systemic therapy as part of concurrent treatment approach for previously diagnosed stage III NSCLC, adjuvant therapy for stage III NSCLC, as adjuvant therapy for previously resected NSCLC, or for other previous cancers is permitted.
