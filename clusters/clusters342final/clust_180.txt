The following agents are not permitted while patients are taking MLN8237, and should be discontinued at prior to registration if patients are taking them:* Patients must stop using the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for at least 4 days prior to the first dose of MLN8237; administration of PPI while on study is not permitted* Histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists are not permitted from the day prior through to the end of MLN8237 dosing, except as required for premedication for rituximab; constant dosing of H2 blockers is not permitted* Antacid preparations are not permitted for 2 hours before or 2 hours after administration of MLN8237* Administration of pancreatic enzymes is not permitted at any time while on study* Co-administration of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine or St. John's wort is not permitted* Concurrent bisphosphonate therapy is allowed if it was started before study entry and is maintained at recommended dosing intervals; if bisphosphonate therapy is initiated after study entry, bone lesions will not be considered evaluable for disease response* Patients must be willing not drive, operate dangerous tools or machinery, or engage in any other potentially hazardous activity that requires full alertness and coordination if they experience excessive sedation; if a patient experiences excessive sedation believed to be related to MLN8237, treatment with MLN8237 should be interrupted* Patients must be willing to limit alcohol consumption to no more than 1 standard unit of alcohol (12 oz beer [350 mL], 1.5 oz [45 mL] of 80-proof alcohol, or one 6-oz [175 mL] glass of wine) per day during the study and for 30 days from the last dose of MLN8237; minimize the use of agents with central nervous system (CNS) effects* Benzodiazepine use is discouraged but not prohibited
Patients must not have documented history of gastric/duodenal ulcer within the last 12 months; participant must not currently be on treatment for gastric/duodenal ulcer or be experiencing symptoms at study entry; patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are eligible, however, and these patients may receive over-the-counter histamine-2 (H2) antagonists; proton-pump inhibitors, or other prescription-based treatment for GERD
History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MLN8237, including but not limited to established allergic reaction to benzodiazepines, or romidepsin; agents that alter gastric pH may change MLN8237 absorption are not permitted; proton pump inhibitors need to be stopped 4 days prior to the first dose of MLN8237; histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists are not permitted from the day prior (day -1) through to the end of MLN8237 dosing; antacid preparations are not permitted for 2 hours before or 2 hours after administration of MLN8237
Requirement for constant administration of proton pump inhibitor, H2 antagonist, or pancreatic enzymes; intermittent uses of antacids or H2 antagonists are allowed
For weekly MLN0128 (TAK-228) dose cohorts, patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are ineligible unless these patients are able to switch to a histamine (H2) blocker and/or antacid
Patients must not be receiving any proton pump inhibitors at the time of registration
Patients who are taking proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within 7 days before receiving the first dose of study drug or who require treatment with PPIs throughout the trial or those who are taking H2 receptor antagonists within 24 hours of the first dose of study drug
Concomitant administration of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not permitted during the study; patients receiving PPI therapy before enrollment must stop using the PPI for 7 days before their first dose of study drugs
Concomitant administration of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not permitted during the study; patients receiving PPI therapy before enrollment must stop using the PPI for 7 days before their first dose of study drugs
Concomitant administration of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not permitted during the study; patients receiving PPI therapy before enrollment must stop using the PPI for 7 days before their first dose of study drugs
No concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is allowed; any prior PPI must be discontinued at least one week before receiving MLN0128 (TAK-228)
Treatment with proton pump inhibitors within 3 days prior to study entry; if treatment with an histamine (H2)-receptor antagonist such as ranitidine is required, erlotinib must be taken 10 hours after the H2-receptor antagonist dosing and at least 2 hours before the next dose of the H2-receptor antagonist; although the effect of antacids on erlotinib pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated, the antacid dose and the erlotinib dose should be separated by several hours, if an antacid is necessary
Chronic concomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors must discontinue the drug for 7 days prior to registration on the study
Patients CANNOT have daily or chronic use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and/or having taken a PPI within 7 days before receiving the first dose of study drug
