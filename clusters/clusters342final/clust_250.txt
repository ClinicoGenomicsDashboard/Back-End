Receiving any medication that has documented data or is generally accepted as having increased risk of QT prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes
Concurrent medications associated with a known risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes are not allowed within 2 weeks of initiation of study treatment; those medications listed as a possible risk for causing QTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes will be allowed, although if an alternative medication can be substituted, that would be preferable; granisetron is an acceptable antiemetic on this study, but if a patient must take ondansetron, they may NOT take any other concomitant agents which might impact their QTc
Patients with current evidence of significant cardiovascular disease (New York Heart Association class III or IV cardiac disease), symptomatic congestive heart failure, dilated/hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction (within the past 6 months), unstable angina, unstable arrhythmia or a need for anti-arrhythmic therapy (use of medications for rate control for atrial fibrillation is allowed such as calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers, if stable medication for at least last month prior to initiation of romidepsin treatment and medication not listed as causing Torsades de Pointes), or evidence of acute ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG); marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval, e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval > 450 msec*; long QT syndrome; the required use of concomitant medication that may cause Torsades de Pointes or may cause a significant prolongation of the QTc* Note: due to difficulties assessing QTc in patients with heart block, they may be eligible if deemed safe by a cardiologist; if a patient must take ondansetron as their antiemetic, their QTc may NOT be over 450 (no exception for patients with heart block)
Required use of a concomitant medication that can prolong the QT interval
Patients with significant cardiovascular disease (New York Heart Association class III or IV cardiac disease), symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable angina, unstable arrhythmia or a need for anti-arrhythmic therapy (use of frequency adjusting medication for atrial fibrillation is allowed, if stable medication for at least last month prior to initiation of belinostat treatment and medication not listed as causing Torsades de Pointes), or evidence of acute ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG); marked baseline prolongation of QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval, e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval > 450 msec; long QT syndrome; concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or cause Torsades de Pointes is not allowed during the study or within 2 weeks of study entry; these drugs should also be avoided for up to 4 weeks following discontinuation of study treatment; drugs that may be associated with Torsades de Pointes but lack substantial evidence will be allowed at the discretion of the PI (although it is preferable to substitute an alternate medication), and patients will be closely monitored
Patients should avoid concomitant medication known or suspected to prolong QTc interval or cause Torsades De Pointes; if possible, alternative agents should be considered; patients who are receiving drugs that prolong the QTc are eligible if the drug is necessary and no alternatives are available
Correct QT interval (QTc) =< 480 msec; Note: Patients should avoid concomitant medication known or suspected to prolong QTc interval or cause torsades de pointes; if possible, alternative agents should be considered; patients who are receiving drugs that prolong the QTc are eligible if the drug is necessary and no alternatives are available
Patients who require use of a concomitant medication that can prolong the QT interval
Receiving any medications that prolong the QTc and have a known risk for Torsades de pointes; providers should use caution with drugs with possible increased risk for Torsades de pointes; NOTE: patient will be eligible if they can be taken off these medications prior to initiation of therapy and no less than 4 half-lives of the medication
Certain medications that are associated with a risk for QTc prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes, although not prohibited, should be avoided or replaced with medications that do not carry these risks, if possible
Drugs that are known to increase torsades de pointes should be avoided; patients must discontinue these medications prior to enrollment on study; selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal torsades de pointes potential is recommended
Corrected QT (QTc) =< 480 msec* Note: Patients should avoid concomitant medication known or suspected to prolong QTc interval or cause Torsades De Pointes; If possible, alternative agents should be considered* Patients who are receiving drugs that prolong the QTc are eligible if the drug is necessary and no alternatives are available
Patients who are receiving drugs that prolong QTc are not eligible
Known history of QT/corrected QT (QTc) prolongation or torsades de pointes (TdP); patients who are currently receiving treatment with medication with a known risk to prolong the QT interval or inducing torsades de pointes and the treatment cannot either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drugs
Corrected QT (QTc) interval =< 480 milliseconds; Note: Patients should avoid concomitant medication known or suspected to prolong QTc interval or cause Torsades De Pointes; if possible, alternative agents should be considered; patients who are receiving drugs that prolong the QTc are eligible if the drug is necessary and no alternatives are available
