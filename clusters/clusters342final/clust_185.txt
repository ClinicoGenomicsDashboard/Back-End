PHASE II: All patients enrolled in the Phase II portion of this trial must have a history of biopsy-proven ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer
Patients randomized to either arm may also co-enroll in phase III trials that compare local therapies, or compare systemic therapies (such as chemotherapy, if randomized to Arm I of S1007)
PHASE I:
PHASE II:
PHASE I AND II:
PHASE I PATIENTS:
Phase II only: patients with colorectal cancer with known microsatellite instability (MSI)-high disease who have previously been treated with immunotherapy or who have refused treatment with immunotherapy
PHASE I (ARMS A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, X, Y, Z)
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must have pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL); a biopsy at any relapse is acceptable; other histologies including lymphocyte predominant (LP) HL are not permitted
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients may have received prior brentuximab vedotin, but must not have received brentuximab vedotin within 6 months prior to registration, and must not have relapsed within 6 months of receiving previous brentuximab vedotin; patients may not have received prior nivolumab or PD1/PDL1 axis agents; patients may not have received prior ipilimumab
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients may not have received other prior activating immunotherapies (i.e. checkpoint inhibitor therapies); for the purposes of this study monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates are not considered to be activating immunotherapies and there are no additional time restrictions on prior exposure to these agents (except prior brentuximab vedotin)
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): ECOG-ACRIN performance status between 0-2
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): ANC >= 1500/mcL (1.5 x 0^9/L), obtained within 2 weeks prior to registration
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): AST/ALT =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), obtained within 2 weeks prior to registration
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patient must have no current or prior history of CNS involvement
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): All prior therapy must have been completed at least 21 days prior to enrollment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C); no concomitant anti lymphoma therapy, including systemic corticosteroids for the purpose of treatment of lymphoma are allowed; topical steroids are allowed
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must not have previously existing hypersensitivity to brentuximab vedotin or ipilimumab
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must not be participating in any other clinical trial or taking any other experimental medications within 21 days prior to registration
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Routine vaccinations, including seasonal influenza, should be given at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment; vaccines are not prohibited on study, but must be given at least 6 weeks after cycle 1 and not within 7 days of treatment
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must not currently be smoking tobacco or other agents
PHASE II PORTION ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
PHASE I SUBJECTS ONLY: Patients must not have received prior navitoclax, unless the patient received < 7 days of navitoclax lead-in on this or another study and had to stop for reasons other than toxicity or disease progression; in the phase II portion of the study
Feasibility Phase: Patients must be < 21 years of age at the time of enrollment; please note: the feasibility phase is complete, effective with amendment #1
