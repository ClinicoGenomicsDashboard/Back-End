Patients treated with prior Interleukin-2 will be allowed to be in this study
Having chronic hepatitis B or C will not exclude patients from participating if they are otherwise eligible; however, requiring treatment with interferon is an exclusion; patients must be stable without having received interferon in at least 4 weeks
Patients may not have received prior interferon, either systemic or intra-cystic
Patients who have received any of the following concomitant therapy: interleukin (IL)-2, interferon; immunosuppressive agents; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (used in the management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses)
Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 [aldesleukin]) within 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1.
Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon [IFN]-alpha or interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1
Patients must not have had systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy, including, but not limited to interferon alfa-2b, high dose interleukin 2 (IL-2), pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, intra-tumoral, or vaccine therapies within 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1; patients must not have received or be planning to receive any of the prohibited therapies during protocol treatment; prior intravesical interferon therapy is allowed
Prior treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon [IFN]-alpha or interleukin [IL]-2) is allowed, provided the following is met: minimum of 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1
Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon [IFN]-alpha or interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1
Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon [IFN]-alpha or interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1
Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon [IFN]-alpha or interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1
