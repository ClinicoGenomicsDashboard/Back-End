Patient with poorly controlled diabetes (defined as fasting glucose level > 200 mg/dL; optimally participants will have glucose < 150 mg/dL) despite attempts to improve glucose control by fasting duration and adjustment of medications
Random or fasting blood glucose within the upper normal limits for age; if the initial blood glucose is a random sample that is outside of the normal limits, then a follow-up fasting blood glucose can be obtained and must be within the upper normal limits for age
Diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance, defined as a fasting glucose > 125 mg/dL
TREATMENT: Patients who have poorly controlled diabetes (defined as fasting blood glucose of > 160 mg/dL (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade >= 2) and glycated hemoglobin (HgA1c) > 8% are ineligible to receive treatment with everolimus on study; patients with fasting blood glucose > 160 mg/dL may be eligible if the HgA1c < 8%, per PI discretion
It is recommended glucose be drawn fasting >= 8 hrs; glucose < 126 (diabetics 4075 years of age are not eligible), within 30 days prior to enrollment* If glucose is >= 126 the glucose should be repeated fasting to determine eligibility
Fasting triglyceride =< 2.5 x ULN
Fasting serum glucose =< 130 MG/DL
Patients with controlled diabetes are allowed on study; controlled diabetes is defined as < 130 ml/dL for the sake of this study
Patients with known diabetes mellitus which is poorly controlled (defined as hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] > 7%) are ineligible; subjects with a history of transient glucose intolerance due to corticosteroid administration are allowed in this study if all other inclusion/exclusion have been met
Fasting serum glucose =< 130 mg/dL
Uncontrolled diabetes (fasting serum glucose > 130 mg/dl) despite best medical management or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus defined as hemoglobin (Hb)A1c > 7%; subjects with a history of transient glucose intolerance due to corticosteroid administration are allowed in this study if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met
Metabolic: fasting serum glucose (=< 130 mg/dL) and fasting triglycerides =< 300 mg/dL
Patients must have a normal blood sugar level for age to participate; if an initial random draw (ie. non-fasting) blood glucose value is out of range, it is acceptable to repeat this test as a fasting draw
Fasting serum glucose =< 130 mg/dL
Patients with controlled diabetes are allowed on study; controlled diabetes is defined as fasting blood sugar (FBS) = 130 mg/dL or less, and patients whose FBS can be brought in this range with medical therapy are eligible for trial inclusion
Fasting serum glucose =< 130 mg/dL
Patients with controlled diabetes are allowed on study; controlled diabetes is defined as fetal bovine serum (FBS) =< 130 mg/dL in the context of this study
Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose > 130 mg/dL)
Patient does not have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (i.e., fasting blood glucose > 200 mg/dL)
Fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 130 mg/dL
Patients with diabetes controlled by diet or medication are allowed on trial; controlled diabetes is defined as FBG < 130 mg/kL in the context of this study
Fasting plasma glucose =< 130 mg/dL (or 7.2 mmol/L)
Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose controlled by medication, =< 200 mg/dL allowed)
Glucose < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/L) or > 250 mg/dl (> 14mmol/L)
Normal blood glucose for age
Within less than or equal to 14 days prior to registration: Fasting serum glucose =< 130 mg/dL
Diabetics are allowed if:* Fasting blood glucose (FBG) =< 130 mg/dL (mmol/L),OR* HbA1c =< 7%
Random or fasting blood glucose =< the upper normal limits for age; if the initial blood glucose is a random sample that is outside of the normal limits, then follow-up fasting blood glucose can be obtained and must be =< the upper normal limits for age
Patients must have a normal blood sugar level for age; if an initial random draw (i.e. non-fasting) blood glucose value is out of range, it is acceptable to repeat this test as a fasting draw
