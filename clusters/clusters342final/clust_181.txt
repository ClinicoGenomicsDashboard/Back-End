Willingness to provide the biologic specimens is required by the protocol; this is part of the mandatory correlative research component; these specimens include:- PHASE I: peripheral blood for plasma pharmacokinetic analysis and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) polymer assessment from 0-24 h after drug administration on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 as well as day 2 of cycle 2; urine for assessment of ABT-888 renal clearance for 24 h after administration of drugs on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 as well as day 2 of cycle 2; and a pretreatment peripheral blood sample for possible sequencing of the BRCA1, BRCA2 loci as well as possible pharmacogenomic analysis
Willingness to allow the provision of tissue samples for correlative research, as long as adequate tissues are available; patients will not be excluded from participation in the study, if they are willing to allow provision of tissues for the correlative research, but there are insufficient quantities of tissue for the correlative analyses (e.g., a patient otherwise eligible and willing who had biopsy only)Willingness to allow the provision of blood samples for correlative research; patients are not excluded from participation in the study, if they are willing to provide the mandatory biospecimens for translational/correlative research, but for logistical reasons the specimens(s) were not obtainable or if the volume collected was insufficient
Willing to provide blood samples for correlative research purposes
Tissue acquisition: patient must agree to provide the required research biopsies at baseline, week 4 and at surgery for integral and integrated biomarker and correlative studies
Willing to provide tissue samples for correlative research purposes
Willingness to provide blood and urine samples for research purposes
Willingness to provide tissue and blood samples for mandatory translational research
Willingness to provide blood and new tumor biopsy samples for research purposes if on the expansion phase of the study
Willingness to provide biopsy samples for research purposes (patients >= 18 years of age at the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Clinical Center only)
Willingness to provide mandatory tissue and blood samples for correlative studies
