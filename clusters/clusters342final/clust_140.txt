With the exception of steroid pretreatment (defined below) or the administration of intrathecal cytarabine, patients must not have received any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the current diagnosis of B-ALL or B-LLy or for any cancer diagnosed prior to initiation of protocol therapy on AALL0932* Patients receiving prior steroid therapy may be eligible for AALL0932
Patients with central nervous system 3 (CNS3) leukemia* CNS status must be known prior to enrollment; (Note: the CNS status must be determined based on a sample obtained prior to administration of any systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, except for steroid pretreatment); B-LLy patients with CNS3 disease are not eligible for this protocol or the COG HR ALL protocol; it is recommended that intrathecal cytarabine be administered at the time of the diagnostic lumbar puncture; this is usually done at the time of the diagnostic bone marrow or venous line placement to avoid a second lumbar puncture; this is allowed prior to registration; systemic chemotherapy must begin within 72 hours of the first dose of intrathecal therapy
Participants who received any lymphoma directed chemotherapy or radiotherapy with the exception of a single dose of intrathecal chemotherapy given at the time of the diagnostic lumbar puncture (spinal tap); patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy for Kaposis sarcoma > 2 years prior to study enrollment are allowed as long as the prior treatment did not include doxorubicin in its non-liposomal form; prior exposure to liposomal doxorubicin is allowed; prior exposure to intrathecal therapy given as prophylaxis within 30 days is allowed
Intrathecal chemotherapy prior to enrollment is allowed for the current diagnosis of ALCL as long as adequate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obtained prior to administration of the intrathecal chemotherapy and subsequently demonstrated to be negative for ALCL
Patients with known active central nervous system leukemia should be excluded from this clinical trial; patient receiving intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis should not receive pomalidomide for >= 3 days after administration
Cytotoxic therapy: at least 14 days since the completion of cytotoxic therapy with the exception of hydroxyurea, which is permitted up to 24 hours prior to the start of protocol therapy, or maintenance chemotherapy, or intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate strongly preferred) administered at the time of the required diagnostic lumbar puncture to establish baseline CNS status
With the exception of intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate strongly preferred; cytarabine is permissible) administered at the time of the required diagnostic lumbar puncture to establish baseline CNS status, patient has not received prior relapse-directed therapy (i.e., this protocol is intended as the INITIAL treatment of first relapse)
Patients must not have received any cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the current diagnosis of T-ALL, T-L-Ly or for any cancer diagnosis prior to the initiation of protocol therapy on AALL1231, with the exception of:* Steroid pretreatment: prednisone or methylprednisolone for =< 120 hours (5 days) in the 7 days prior to initiating induction chemotherapy or for =< 336 hours (14 days) in the 28 days prior to initiating induction chemotherapy; prior exposure to ANY steroids that occurred > 28 days before the initiation of protocol therapy does not affect eligibility; the dose of prednisone or methylprednisolone does not affect eligibility* Intrathecal cytarabine (the CNS status must be determined based on a sample obtained prior to administration of any systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, except for steroid pretreatment) system chemotherapy must begin with 72 hours of this IT therapy; or* 600 cGy of chest irradiation, if medically necessary** Pre-treatment with dexamethasone in the 28 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy is not allowed with the exception of a single dose of dexamethasone use during sedation to prevent or treat airway edema; inhalation steroids and topical steroids are not considered pretreatment
Patients must have a lumbar puncture to determine CNS involvement of ALL within 14 days prior to registration; patients with CNS3 are excluded from the trial; patients with CNS1 or CNS2 will be eligible, but will be monitored for CNS involvement; note that intrathecal methotrexate administered during the pre-study lumbar puncture may count as the first dose of intrathecal therapy required as part of the study
Treatment with hydroxyurea, corticosteroids (any route) and intrathecal cytarabine prior to beginning protocol directed therapy is allowed; however, it should be noted that lumbar puncture and intrathecal therapy at initial diagnosis of APL is not recommended
Intrathecal cytotoxic therapy:* No waiting period is required for patients having received intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and/or hydrocortisone* At least 14 days must have elapsed since receiving liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) by intrathecal injection
Central nervous system (CNS) status must be determined based on a sample obtained prior to the administration of any systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, with the exception of steroid pretreatment
With the exception of steroid pretreatment or the administration of intrathecal methotrexate or intrathecal cytarabine, receipt of any other prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the current diagnosis of B-ALL or any cancer diagnosed prior to the initiation of protocol therapy on AALL15P1
Participants with known central nervous system (CNS) involvement with leukemia or who are receiving intrathecal chemotherapy that is either prophylactic or therapeutic; history of CNS involvement that has been completely treated (no longer receiving intrathecal chemotherapy) will be allowed
No prior therapy for ALL except for limited treatment (=< 7 days) with corticosteroids or hydroxyurea and a single dose of intrathecal cytarabine; however, patients who are being treated with chronic steroids for other reasons (for example, to treat asthma, autoimmune disorders, lupus, etc.) are eligible
Single-dose intrathecal cytarabine is allowed prior to registration or prior to initiation of systematic therapy for patient convenience; systemic chemotherapy must begin within 72 hours of this intrathecal therapy
