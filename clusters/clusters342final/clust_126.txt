Patients must not have received the therapies indicated below for the specified time period prior to the first day of administration of protocol therapy on this study* Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: must have received last dose at least 2 weeks prior to protocol therapy; this includes cytotoxic agents given on a low dose metronomic regimen* Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent) (includes retinoids): must have received last dose at least 7 days prior to protocol therapy* Monoclonal antibodies: must have received last dose at least 7 days or 3 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to protocol therapy
At least 7 days must have elapsed since the completion of therapy with a non-myelosuppressive biologic agent or retinoid
Patient must have received their last dose of the biologic agent >= 7 days prior to study registration* For biologic agents that have a prolonged half-life, at least three half-lives must have elapsed prior to registration
Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or radiotherapy prior to study entry* Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Patients must have received their last dose of known myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least three weeks prior to registration on the Re-treatment Study or at least six weeks if a nitrosourea* Biologic agent: Patient must have received their last dose of the biologic agent >= 7 days prior to study registration; for biologic agents and monoclonal antibody treatment, at least three half-lives must have elapsed prior to registration* Other investigational agents (not fitting into one of the above specified categories): patients must have received their last dose of any other investigational agent greater than 28 days prior to enrollment* Radiation: Patients must have:** Had their last fraction of local irradiation to the primary tumor >= 12 months prior to registration; investigators are reminded to review potentially eligible cases to avoid confusion with pseudo-progression;** Had their last fraction of craniospinal irradiation (> 24Gy) > 3 months prior to registration* Corticosteroids: Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to registration* Growth factors: Patients must be off all colony-forming growth factor(s) for at least 1 week prior to registration (filgrastim, sargramostim, erythropoietin) and at least 2 weeks for long-acting formulations
Patients who have received prior biologic agents less than 30 days prior to enrollment
Use of an investigational agent within the past 30 days
Subjects must have received their last dose of investigational or biologic agent >= 7 days prior to study registration* In the event that a subject has received an investigational or biologic agent and has experienced >= grade 2 myelosuppression, then at least three (3) weeks must have elapsed prior to registration* If the investigational or biologic agent has a prolonged half-life (>= 7 days) then at least three (3) weeks must have elapsed prior to registration
At least 7 days after the last dose of a biologic agent; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration of this interval must be discussed with the study chair
Biologic (anti-neoplastic) agent: at least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a biologic agent; for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur
Biologic therapy: patients should have received their last dose of biologic agent >= 7 days prior to enrollment; in the event the patient has received another biologic agent and has experienced >= grade 2 myelosuppression, then at least three (3) weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment; if the investigational or biologic agent has a prolonged half-life then at least three (3) weeks interval is required
Biologic or investigational agent (anti-neoplastic): Patient must have received their last dose of the investigational or biologic agent >= 7 days prior to study enrollment * For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration must be discussed with and approved by the study chair* Monoclonal antibody treatment and/or agents with prolonged half-lives: at least three half-lives must have elapsed prior to enrollment
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STRATUM C: Patient must have received their last dose of the investigational or biologic agent >= 7 days prior to study enrollment* For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur; the duration must be discussed with and approved by the study chair* Monoclonal antibody treatment and/or agents with prolonged half-lives: at least three half-lives must have elapsed prior to enrollment
Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): at least 7 days since the completion of therapy with a biologic agent such as steroids, retinoids; Note: for agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration (i.e. monoclonal antibodies), this period must be extended beyond the time during which acute adverse events are known to occur
RECURRENT/ PROGRESSIVE DIPG (STRATUM 1): Biologic or investigational agent (anti-neoplastic): patient must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to the agent and received their last dose of the investigational or biologic agent >= 7 days prior to study enrollment * For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur, and discussed with the principal investigator
Biologic agent - must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to the agent and received their last dose of the biologic agent > 7 days prior to study enrollment* For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to occur
