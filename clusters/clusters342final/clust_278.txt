Participants must be purified protein derivative (PPD) negative; alternatively, the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay can be used; an individual is considered positive for M. tuberculosis infection if the IFN-gamma response to tuberculosis (TB) antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control); the result must be obtained within 12 weeks prior to enrollment; PPD positive (or Quantiferon assay positive) participants are permitted if prophylaxis has been completed prior to enrollment
All potential patients must undergo a tuberculosis (TB) test prior to study entry (either purified protein derivative [PPD] or QuantiFERON-TB Gold, whichever is preferred and available at the Institution); patients with a history of TB (even if treated), or evidence of active or latent TB, are excluded; the diagnosis of active TB is defined per current guidelines; patients with a positive TB test (e.g. PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold) will be excluded; patients with history of Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination will be tested with QuantiFERON-TB Gold test in order to rule out exposure to TB
Active tuberculosis (TB):* Patients who are undergoing first month of therapy (RIPE or equivalent) for active TB* Patients with TB immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) requiring corticosteroids** Note: patients who are receiving therapy beyond month one of initial therapy with no evidence of TB IRIS requiring corticosteroid therapy, or those receiving treatment for latent tuberculosis (INH or alternative) may be eligible after discussion with the protocol P.I.
