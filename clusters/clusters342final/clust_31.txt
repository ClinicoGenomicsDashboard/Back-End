The patient must have an identified caregiver who is willing and able to oversee the training practice during the intervention period (ie, for 5-9 weeks starting approximately 3 months after completion of CRT)
Patients who have had (prior to entering the study): major surgery and biologic/antibody therapies (including immunotherapies) are not permitted within 4 weeks of romidepsin administration; anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal (with the exception of hormones for thyroid conditions), and other investigational agents will not be allowed within 14 days or five (5) half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of romidepsin (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C); additionally, participants must have recovered to less than grade 2 clinically significant adverse effect(s)/toxicity(ies) of the previous therapy, with the exception of alopecia, unless approved by the principal investigator
Patients must be adequately recovered from surgery at the time of randomization
Patients who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier* Note: patients with =< grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study* Note: if patients received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy
At least 2 weeks from end of targeted therapy
