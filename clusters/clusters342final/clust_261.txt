TREATMENT: Bilirubin =< 2 x upper limit of normal
Serum bilirubin > 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
Total bilirubin must be < 1.5 x the upper limit of normal, unless the elevation of bilirubin is thought to be secondary to Gilberts syndrome or combined antiretroviral therapy (cART); if, however, the elevated bilirubin is felt to be secondary to antiretroviral therapy, the total bilirubin must be =< 3.5 mg/dL, provided that the direct bilirubin is normal and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 3 x the upper limit of normal; also, if the elevated bilirubin is thought to be secondary to cHL the same criteria for hyperbilirubinemia should be applied; however 1 prior cycle of cyclophosphamide is permitted in attempt to make the participant eligible; patients should not be excluded from study participation unless dosing cannot be safely established

Bilirubin =< 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) (or =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal [ULN] with Gilberts syndrome)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless Gilberts syndrome or disease infiltration of the liver is present)
Bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN upper limit of normal (except in patients with documented Gilberts disease, who must have a total bilirubin =< 3.0 mg/dL), must be obtained within 8 weeks prior to screening for protocol therapy
Serum bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except subjects with known Gilberts syndrome
Total bilirubin =< 1.25 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), with the exception of < 2.9 mg/dL for patients with Gilberts disease
Within 2 weeks prior to screening step registration and within 4 weeks prior to treatment step registration: Total bilirubin =< 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless documented Gilberts syndrome, for which bilirubin =< 3 x institutional ULN is permitted)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); except in case of Gilberts disease
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless isolated hyperbilirubinemia attributed to Gilberts syndrome
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); an exception to this may be allowed for participants with Gilberts syndrome with documented approval by the protocol chair
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with Gilberts syndrome may have serum bilirubin > 1.5 ULN)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless due to Gilberts syndrome or hemolysis, in which case =< 3.0 x ULN is allowed
Total bilirubin < 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN); or < 3 x institutional ULN for Gilberts syndrome or HIV protease inhibitors; or < 5 x ULN and direct bilirubin < 0.7 mg/dL for patients on atazanavir containing HIV regimen
