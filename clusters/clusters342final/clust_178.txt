Patients with a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection might be enrolled if the viral load by PCR is undetectable with/without active treatment
Patients are excluded if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection
Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection
Patients must not have a known history of active hepatitis B infection (defined as presence of hepatitis B surface antigen [Hep B sAg] and/ or Hep B deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]), active hepatitis C infection (defined as presence of hepatitis C [Hep C] ribonucleic acid [RNA]) and/or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible; patients who have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C antibody (hepatitis C virus [HCV] Ab)/ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection are also ineligible (baseline testing required)
Patients should be excluded if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection
CLINICAL/LABORATORY CRITERIA: Patients must not have a known history of active hepatitis B or C infection (defined as presence of hepatitis [Hep] B surface antigen [sAg] and/or Hep B deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and/or Hep C ribonucleic acid [RNA]); patients must not have a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity
Patients must not have a known positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection; patients with a positive hepatitis C antibody with a negative viral load are allowed
Patients with a known positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection might be enrolled if the viral load by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is undetectable with/without active treatment
Patients must not have known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or a known positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg), or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating current acute or chronic infection; patients with a positive hepatitis C antibody with a negative viral load are allowed
