Patients who are currently receiving therapeutic anticoagulants (including aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, warfarin and others) are not eligible
Patients on warfarin will be excluded from the trial if they cannot be switched to an acceptable alternative medication (i.e. low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]); prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were observed in patients receiving vorinostat concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants
Warfarin is not permitted
The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel); low dose aspirin (=< 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (=< 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted (please note that there may be cases in which patients on study require anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis [DVT]/pulmonary embolism [PE] management; this does not necessitate taking the patient off study)
The participant requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or factor xabans (Xa) inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel); low dose aspirin (=< 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (=< 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted

TREATMENT: Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin are excluded; low molecular weight heparin is permitted for prophylactic or therapeutic use
Patients must not be on phenytoin, warfarin or methadone
Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate; prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency
Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate; prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency
Participants who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular weight or standard heparin and not warfarin
Current use of anticoagulation; NOTE: use of low-dose anticoagulation medications (such as heparin) that are used to maintain the patency of a central intravenous catheter is allowed
Concurrent use of anti-coagulants (warfarin, etc.) other than low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH); medication must be stopped before time of registration; if patient has recently been on anti-coagulants other than LMWH, patient must have international normalized ratio (INR) =< 2
Patients must not have any serious or unstable pre-existing medical conditions (aside from malignancy exceptions specified above), including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics on day 1, history of bleeding diathesis or need for concurrent anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] =< 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time [PTT] within 1.1 x ULN), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, interfere with subjects safety, or obtaining informed consent; therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of prothrombin time (PT)/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate; prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency
The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel); low dose aspirin (=< 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (=< 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted

The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors; aspirin (up to 325 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (=< 1 mg/day), prophylactic and therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted
Participants on any dose of warfarin or are on full dose anticoagulation with other agents including low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin agents, antiplatelet agents and full dose aspirin within 7 days prior to study enrollment; participants on prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin are allowed
Patient must not require the use of full dose coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin; low molecular weight heparin is permitted for prophylactic or therapeutic use; factor X inhibitors are permitted* NOTE: Warfarin may not be started while enrolled in the EAY131 study* Stopping the anticoagulation for biopsy should be per site standard operating procedure (SOP)
Patients who are currently receiving therapeutic anti-coagulation with heparin, low-molecular weight heparin or Coumadin are not eligible for this trial
Patients may not have evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis; therapeutic anticoagulation for prior thromboembolic events is permitted; the clinical indication for therapeutic anticoagulation must be clearly documented prior to enrollment and must be discussed with the P.I.; patients who are on greater than or equal to 2 anti-thrombotic agents, including but not limited to anti-platelet agents (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]/aspirin, clopidogrel), heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, and a direct thrombin inhibitor, will be excluded
No concurrent anticoagulation with warfarin or heparin/heparin analogues, clopidogrel, oral direct thrombin inhibitors, or direct factor XA inhibitors
Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) will be permitted; patients receiving treatment with warfarin or any of the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban) will be given the option to switch to LMWH

Concomitant anticoagulation with oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, direct thrombin, and Factor Xa inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel) are prohibited* Note: Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines) and low dose, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are permitted; anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH is allowed in subjects without radiographic evidence of brain metastasis, who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks before first dose of study treatment, and who have had no complications from a thromboembolic event or the anticoagulation regimen
Patients who are currently receiving therapeutic anticoagulants (including aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, and others) are not eligible
If patients require anticoagulation while on protocol, they should be switched from warfarin to another alternative anticoagulant such as low molecular weight heparin or oral direct factor Xa inhibitors as deemed appropriate by the treating physician for the duration they are on capecitabine (must be switched at least 1 week prior to starting capecitabine) to avoid drug-drug interaction of warfarin with capecitabine
Patients may not be on coumarin anti-coagulants (warfarin, etc.); heparin, low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or other antithrombotic medications are permitted
Patients must be able and willing to receive prophylaxis with daily aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, factor X inhibitors or warfarin if randomized to lenalidomide; patients must also be willing to receive pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, dapsone, atovaquone or inhaled pentamidine, in the event that they are randomized to TGR-1202; patients unable or unwilling to take any listed prophylaxis are NOT eligible
