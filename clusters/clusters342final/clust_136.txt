Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma within 180 days of registration at moderate- to high-risk for recurrence as determined by one of the following combinations:             * Gleason score 7-10 + T1c-T2b (palpation) + prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 50 ng/mL (includes intermediate- and high-risk patients)* Gleason score 6 + T2c-T4 (palpation) + PSA < 50 ng/mL OR Gleason score 6 + >= 50% (positive) biopsies + PSA < 50 ng/ml* Gleason score 6 + T1c-T2b (palpation) + PSA > 20 ng/mL* Patients previously diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance who are re-biopsied and found to have unfavorable intermediate risk disease or favorable high risk disease according to the protocol criteria are eligible for enrollment within 180 days of the repeat biopsy procedure
Previous radical surgery (prostatectomy) or cryosurgery for prostate cancer
ARM II ONLY: For patients status post prostatectomy, a PSA >= 0.2 ng/ml
Patients post-prostatectomy with baseline Gleason >= 7 (per prostatectomy pathology)
Baseline PSA nadir >= 0.2 ng/ml (post-operative value is never undetectable) obtained prior to step 1 registration
Baseline testosterone level obtained post prostatectomy prior to step 1 registration
Pathologically (histologically) proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate as confirmed at time of prostatectomy; prostatectomy must have been performed =< 365 days (1 year) prior to step 1 registration any type of radical prostatectomy is permitted, including retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic or robotically assisted; (please note: Prior ablative treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy or focal high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy [HIFU] prior to prostatectomy is allowed)
Prostatectomy performed greater than 365 days (1 year) prior to step 1 registration
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated primarily with radical prostatectomy* Any type of radical prostatectomy will be permitted, including retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic, or robotically assisted; there is no time limit for the date of radical prostatectomy
A post-radical prostatectomy study entry PSA >= 45 days after prostatectomy and within 30 days prior to step 1, < 2.0 ng/mL
A post-prostatectomy PSA nadir >= 0.2 ng/mL AND Gleason >= 7
Androgen deprivation therapy started prior to prostatectomy for > 6 months (180 days) duration; * Note: The use of finasteride or dutasteride ( tamsulosin) for longer periods prior to prostatectomy is acceptable
Androgen deprivation therapy started after prostatectomy and prior to step 1 registration for > 6 weeks (42 days)
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before or after prostatectomy
