Cardiac ejection fraction >= 45% or within institutional normal limits; a nuclear medicine gated blood pool examination is preferred; a two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiogram (ECHO) scan is acceptable if a calculated ejection fraction is obtained and follow-up measurement of the cardiac ejection fraction will also be performed by echocardiography; measurement of cardiac ejection fraction should be within two weeks prior to receiving treatment* NOTE: when a multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram cannot be obtained due to weekend or holiday, then patients may be enrolled provided there is no history of significant cardiovascular disease and a measurement of cardiac ejection fraction will be performed within 5 days of study enrollment
Patients must have a cardiac ejection fraction of >= 40%, or within institutional normal limits; a nuclear medicine gated blood pool examination is preferred; a 2-D ECHO scan is acceptable if a calculated ejection fraction is obtained and follow-up measurement of the cardiac ejection fraction will also be performed by echocardiography; measurement of cardiac ejection fraction should be within two weeks prior to allogeneic transplantation
Participants with known congestive heart failure (CHF); if known, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) =< 40% are excluded
Cardiac ejection fraction >= 50% as determined by screening echocardiogram
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 55%
Normal baseline cardiac ejection fraction >= 50%
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= institutional lower limit of normal
Left ventricular ejection fraction >= 45%
Systolic cardiac function will be assessed at screening if clinically indicated by history and physical; only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% will be eligible for enrollment
Patients must have ejection fraction >= 45% based on echocardiogram performed within 28 days prior to registration
Ejection fraction of >= 50%
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% (measured within 28 days of study entry)
Patients must have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 45% or within institutional normal limits
Normal ejection fraction (echocardiogram [ECHO]) >= 53% (if a range is given then the upper value of the range will be used) or cardiac MRI
If cardiac function assessment is clinically indicated or performed: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than normal per institutional guidelines, or < 55%, if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines* Patients with the following risk factors should have a baseline cardiac function assessment:** Prior treatment with anthracyclines** Prior treatment with trastuzumab** Prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart** History of myocardial infarction within 6 to 12 months (patients with history of myocardial infarction within 6 months are excluded from the study)** Prior history of impaired cardiac function
If cardiac function assessment is clinically indicated or performed: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than normal per institutional guidelines, or < 55%, if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines* Patients with the following risk factors should have a baseline cardiac function assessment:** Prior treatment with anthracyclines** Prior treatment with trastuzumab** Prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart** History of myocardial infarction within 6 to 12 months (Patients with history of myocardial infarction within 6 months are excluded from the study)** Prior history of impaired cardiac function
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, regardless of whether there are symptoms of heart failure
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50%
If cardiac function assessment is clinically indicated or performed: participants will be ineligible if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is less than normal per institutional guidelines, or < 55%, if the threshold for normal is not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines
