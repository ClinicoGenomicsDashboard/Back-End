ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PREREGISTRATION (STEP 0):
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SCREENING (STEP 0 - PREREGISTRATION)
Patient may be receiving or have completed induction therapy within 60 days prior to preregistration to step 0; no more than 300 days may have passed between the first day of induction therapy and preregistration to step 0* For patients who have completed induction therapy, restaging evaluation must show status of partial (PR) or complete response (CR); post-induction patients with evidence of clinical disease progression are not eligible for preregistration* Up to two regimens of chemotherapy are allowed as long as a continuous response was ongoing throughout therapy; overall, a partial response needs to have been achieved (using studies at the time of diagnosis as the baseline)**NOTE: For example, a patient who started treatment with rituximab/bendamustine and was then switched to rituximab(R)-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone (CHOP) (due to insufficient response or excessive toxicity) would be counted as having received 2 regimens; however, R-CHOP alternating with R-dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) as a planned induction regimen would count as one regimen
