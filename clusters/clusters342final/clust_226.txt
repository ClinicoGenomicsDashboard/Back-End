Bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dl
If the patient is to be treated with cisplatin, the serum bilirubin of =< 2.0 mg%
Total bilirubin =< grade 1* Note: If total bilirubin is 2 to 3 mg/dL, but direct bilirubin is normal, then the patient will be considered eligible
Total serum bilirubin =< 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (=< grade 1); if total bilirubin is 2 to 3 mg/dL, but direct bilirubin is normal, then the patient will be considered eligible
Total serum bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN* NOTE: if total bilirubin is 2-3 mg/dL, but direct bilirubin is normal, then the patient will be considered eligible
Bilirubin =< grade 1* If bilirubin is 2-3 mg/dL, but direct bilirubin is normal then patient will be considered eligible
Total bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dl
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless elevated secondary to lymphomatous involvement of liver or biliary system, or due to other HIV medications (e.g., indinavir, tenofovir, or atazanavir); if secondary to lymphomatous involvement, an initial upper limit of total bilirubin 5 mg/dL (85.5 uM/L) should be utilized - for direct bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL (20.5 uM/L)
Bilirubin =< 1.5 mg/dL (or =< 3.0 mg/dL if due to Gilbert's syndrome) within 28 days prior to registration
Serum bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL within 28 days prior to registration
STEP I: Bilirubin =< 1.5 mg/dL (obtained within 28 days prior to randomization)
Direct bilirubin =< 1 mg/dL
Serum direct bilirubin < 2 mg/dl or serum total bilirubin =< 3; NOTE: the above stipulation for normal hepatic function does not apply if liver dysfunction is due to leukemia infiltration
Obtained =< 48 hours prior to registration: Serum direct bilirubin < 2 mg/dL or serum total bilirubin =< 3
Total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dL unless due to Gilberts disease, hemolysis or leukemia
Direct bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL
Total bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dL
Total bilirubin < 2.5 mg/dl
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1): Bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN (except in patients with documented Gilberts disease, who must have a total bilirubin =< 3.0 mg/dL)
Bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN; for patients with Gilbert's syndrome, bilirubin =< 3.0 mg/dL is acceptable
Total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dL
Bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL
Bilirubin =< 1.5 mg/dL (or =< 3.0 mg/dL if due to Gilbert's syndrome or if liver metastases are present)
Total bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL
Total bilirubin (=< 1.5 mg/dl) normal unless history of Gilberts syndrome
Total bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL (except patients with Gilbert syndrome, who can have total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL)
Total bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL unless due to Gilberts syndrome, hemolysis, or ineffective hematopoiesis
Direct bilirubin =< 2.0 mg/dL
