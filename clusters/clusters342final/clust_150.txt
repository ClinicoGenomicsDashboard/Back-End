Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the following categories: mediastinal gray zone lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma
Any stage for mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBL)
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1000 unless impairment is due to lymphoma or immune-mediated mechanism caused by lymphoma
Platelets > 100,000 unless impairment is due to lymphoma or immune-mediated mechanism caused by lymphoma
Histologically documented Hodgkin lymphoma subclassified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) modification of the Rye Classification and staged according to the modified Ann Arbor Staging Classification system; patients must have clinical stage IA, IB, IIA or IIB; patients with E extensions will be eligible if all other criteria have been met; nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is excluded
Patients must have biopsy-proven de-novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) * Patients with primary mediastinal lymphoma or testicular lymphoma are not eligible* Patients with prior or simultaneous diagnosis of indolent lymphoma are not eligible* Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder with DLBCL morphology is ineligible
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitts lymphoma, double-hit lymphoma, other c-Myc positive B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large-B cell lymphoma including those patients with history of transformed follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or peripheral T-cell lymphoma
Patients enrolled in the expansion cohort must have biopsiable disease; there will be preferential enrollment of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or ovarian cancer during the dose expansion cohort

Criteria for Solid Tumor Expansion and Lymphoma Cohorts:* Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this cohort are the same as above, with the following rule for CD4 count based on tolerability in Phase I; if, participants with lymphocyte T CD4 count between 100-200/mm^3 (Stratum 2) are shown to tolerate treatment in the Phase I dose de-escalation portion at the same dose level as those with CD4 counts > 200/mm^3 (Stratum 1), participants in the expansion cohort with CD4 counts >= 100/mm^3 are permitted; otherwise, the expansion is open to all solid tumor patients except those whose tumors are known not to respond to nivolumab (pancreas, prostate and MSS colon cancer); for the relapsed refractory HIV-cHL cohort, participants with CD4 count >= 100/mm^3 are permitted
Diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma
Pathologic diagnosis of one of the following:* For dose escalation:** Confirmed diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) or angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) that is refractory to at least one line of therapy; anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and natural killer T-cell lymphoma nasal type (NKTCL) are excluded** Advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), specifically CTCL NOS, small/medium T-cell lymphoma (SMTCL) and mycosis fungoides (MF) stage IB, IIA, IIB, III and IV that have relapsed after at least one specific prior therapy (e.g. interferon, photopheresis, denileukin difitox, bexarotene, etc); anaplastic cutaneous large cell lymphoma (ACLCL) and lymphomatoid papulopsis are excluded** Follicular lymphoma grade 1, 2 or 3A that meets the following criteria: *** Relapsed or refractory to at least 2 lines of therapy AND*** Relapsed or refractory post autologous cell transplantation (HCT)* For dose expansion/dose confirmation phase: ** Patients with confirmed diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) follicular type or angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) that is refractory to at least one line of therapy
Biopsy proven plasmablastic lymphomas, or peripheral T cell lymphoma (with the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive [ALK+] type in first or second complete remission) (timeline 8 months prior to enrollment)
