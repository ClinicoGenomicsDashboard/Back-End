Patients must have achieved a documented complete response to treatment based on normal cancer antigen (CA)-125 (per the institutions upper limit of normal) and computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast (i.e. there must be no clinical evidence of persistent or recurrent disease based on CA-125 and CT scan or MRI with contrast)
Patients must have no evidence of extrapelvic disease; complete workup staging should be performed prior to initiation of therapy to rule-out presence of metastatic disease; this should include: computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax with IV contrast, as well as a CT of the pelvis and abdomen with IV and oral (PO) contrast performed using multi-detector CT and equal or less than 5 mm slice thickness; if the patient is unable to tolerate contrast, then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV gadolinium should be performed; a chest x-ray should be done first, and if abnormal, then a CT scan of the chest should be done
Abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast is preferred; abdominal CT alone is acceptable only if insurance restrictions are experienced; chest CT/x-ray (CT of chest preferred) within 31 days of registration on study (or within 31 days prior to day 1 of chemo post-surgery for those patients having started chemotherapy prior to first step registration); patients allergic to intravenous (IV) contrast can have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen/pelvis instead
Clinically negative lymph nodes as established by imaging (pelvic and/or abdominal computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance [MR]), (but not by nodal sampling, or dissection) within 90 days prior to registration            * Patients with lymph nodes equivocal or questionable by imaging are eligible if the nodes are =< 1.5 cm
Clinical stage: T2N1, T3N0, T3N1* N2 disease is to be estimated as four or more lymph nodes that are >= 10 mm* Clinical staging should be estimated based on the combination of the following assessments: physical exam by the primary surgeon, computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and either a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or an ultrasound (endorectal ultrasound [ERUS]); if a pelvic MRI is performed, it is acceptable to perform CT of the chest/abdomen, omitting CT imaging of the pelvis
Patients must have no evidence of metastasis on positron emission tomography (PET) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis and chest imaging
Assessable disease with a positive bone scan and/or measurable disease on computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis
Patients with evidence of extramedullary disease at diagnosis will have computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to obtain baseline values within 28 days prior to registration
Computerized tomography (CT) urogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) urogram; if urogram protocol not available or contrast allergy/poor renal function preclude such imaging, then noncontrast CT or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis within 45 days of study entry will suffice
Part C: Patients must have measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Patients with screening ALT/AST or ALP above institutional upper limit of normal should have liver ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at any time point between diagnosis of current breast cancer and randomization; screening bone scan is required if ALP and/or corrected calcium level are above the institutional upper limit; (note positron emission tomography [PET]/CT scan may be used as an alternative imaging technique)

Solid tumor patients must be off corticosteroids prior to registration; if GBM patient is receiving corticosteroids, patient must be on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids for at least 5 days prior to baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT); if steroids are added or the steroids dose is increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT is required
Baseline chest computed tomography (CT) with or without contrast must be performed within 6 months (180 days) prior to randomization to ensure no evidence of disease; if clinically indicated additional imaging studies must be performed to rule out metastatic disease
Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in the investigators opinion, could compromise the patients safety, or put the study at undue risk; patients with suspicious radiologic evidence of aspergillosis infection (i.e., chest computed tomography [CT] and/or brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will not be eligible unless confirmatory laboratory testing of beta-D glucan and aspergillus antigen are negative
No evidence of any lymph node spread or distant metastases as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) imaging within 16 weeks of enrollment; alternatively, for those without PET CT capability, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT of the abdomen and pelvis and a chest x-ray confirming no evidence of metastatic disease is acceptable
Patients must have no evidence of metastatic disease or clinically enlarged lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis and CT chest obtained within 28 days of registration (a negative biopsy is required for lymph nodes >= 1 cm in size to confirm lack of involvement); patients with lymph nodes >= 1 cm in whom a biopsy is deemed not feasible are not eligible; patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase or suspicious bone pain should also undergo baseline bone scans to evaluate for bone metastasis
Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase > ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography [PET]-CT, or PET scan) performed within 90 days prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements above are met
