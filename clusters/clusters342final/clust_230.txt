Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective or for whom CPT-11 treatment would be a viable therapy regimen; patients with solid hematologic malignancies (Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas) may be included as long as a bone marrow has been performed within 6 weeks of treatment
Patients enrolled on the dose escalation for intermittent ABT-888 portion of the study must histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective or for whom CPT-11 treatment would be a viable therapy regimen; patients with solid hematologic malignancies (Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas) may be included as long as a bone marrow has been performed within 6 weeks of treatment
PHASE I: Adult patients with histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures or other therapy definitely capable of extending life expectancy does not exist
Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is radiologically evaluable and metastatic or unresectable, for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, and for which there is expectation of response to the combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel (i.e., lung, ovarian, breast, melanoma, head and neck, endometrial, urothelial, testicular, esophageal, carcinoma of unknown primary); for indications not listed, eligibility based on disease must be verified by the principal investigator before they are considered
Patients must have histologically documented (confirmed at the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute [NCI]), relapsed solid tumor malignancy or Hodgkin's disease/non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard curative measures do not exist, or are associated with minimal patient survival benefit
Participants must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor for which no curative therapy exists
Histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube malignancy that is metastatic and for which standard curative measures do not exist
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard treatment that prolongs survival does not exist or is no longer effective
Participants must have known HIV infection and histologically confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; any number of prior cancer therapies will be permitted; at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior chemotherapy or biological therapy, 6 weeks if the regimen included carmustine (BCNU) or mitomycin C; prior radiation therapy to the thoracic cavity, abdomen, or pelvis must be completed at least 3 months prior to registration; radiotherapy to any other site (including bone or brain metastases) must be completed at least 28 days prior to registration
Patients (except those with hepatocellular carcinoma) must have histologically or cytologically confirmed (at original diagnosis or subsequent recurrence or progression) solid tumor or lymphoma that is metastatic, unresectable, progressive, or recurrent, and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; patients with hepatocellular carcinoma do not require biopsy confirmation; a liver mass with raised alpha-fetoprotein level (>= 500 ng/mL), consistent radiographic changes, and serology and viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) measurements consistent with chronic hepatitis will be sufficient to identify hepatocellular carcinoma without the need for pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis; patients with hepatocellular carcinoma must still, however, have disease that has failed standard therapy; having chronic hepatitis B or C will not exclude patients from participating
Patients must have histologically confirmed (by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Pathology Department) solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are associated with minimal patient survival benefit (as defined the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch physicians or if the patient refuses standard of care treatment); enrollment of patients with tumors that can be safely biopsied is encouraged
Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective
Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard curative or palliative treatments do not exist or are no longer effective* Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are not required to have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy, patients are considered eligible based on tumor markers and/or imaging assessment* Patients with the following tumor types will be excluded from the normal and mild cohorts:** Pancreatic cancer patients** Colorectal cancer patients ** BRAF V600E melanoma patients who have failed BRAF inhibitors*** Note: Patients with pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and BRAF V600E melanoma patients who have failed BRAF inhibitors are allowed to enroll in the moderate and severe cohorts provided the patients: 1) sign a separate consent form which outlines the extremely limited activity observed in prior studies, and 2) are consented to the study by a protocol-specified designee who is not their longitudinal oncologist
Patients must have histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of KRAS or NRAS mutation-positive malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; patients must have activating mutations affecting codons 12, 13, 61, or 146 as determined in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified lab to be eligible for this study
For Dose Escalation Cohort: Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective
Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer that is refractory to standard therapy or relapsed after standard therapy; patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective
Patients must have a histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent glioblastoma or an advanced solid tumor in which bevacizumab has shown benefit in specific disease population and for which standard or curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective
Participants must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective; participants with uncontrolled Kaposi sarcoma are permitted (KS must be increasing despite HAART and HIV suppression for greater than or equal to 2 months, or stable KS despite HAART for greater than or equal to 3 months)* For participants in the 24 participant solid tumor cohort, only those histologies not known to respond to single agent nivolumab (such as pancreas, prostate, and microsatellite stable [MSS] colorectal cancer) will be excluded* For participants in the relapsed refractory HIV-cHL expansion cohort, participants must have histologically confirmed, relapsed/refractory (defined as relapsed/refractory to one or greater lines of therapy) HIV-associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma
Dose escalation: patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for whom either standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, or for whom anti-PD-L1/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 is appropriate
Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective
Histologically or pathologically confirmed malignancy (hematologic or solid tumor) that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard of care therapy does not exist or is no longer effective
For the dose escalation cohort, patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective
