Calculated (calc.) creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/min* Estimated creatinine clearance for patients >= 18 years old will be estimated by the Jelliffe equation modified for body surface area (BSA); patients with creatinine clearance estimated > 70ml/min by this formula are eligible; if the creatinine clearance estimated by the Jelliffe method is >= 50 mL/min but =< 70 mL/min, then a second method to confirm a creatinine clearance of >= 50 mL/min is required; methods of estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that can be used for this confirmation consist of a 12 or 24-hour urine creatinine clearance or a nuclear creatinine clearance test; if the confirmatory creatinine clearance is < 50 mL/min, then the patient is not eligible; if the confirmatory creatinine clearance is >= 50 mL/min, the patient is eligible; if the cause of the patients renal dysfunction is tumor obstructing the ureters, then eligibility can be determined by the study chair even if it does not meet these minimal requirements; for patients < 18 years old, it is strongly suggested that a radioisotope estimation of GFR be obtained; if a radioisotope test is not possible, an estimated creatinine clearance using either a 12 or 24 hour urine creatinine clearance or the Schwartz formula can be used; patients will be considered eligible if the creatinine clearance is > 70 mL/min; if the creatinine clearance estimated by the Schwartz formula or urine creatinine clearance is >= 50 mL/min but =< 70 mL/min, then a second method to confirm a creatinine clearance of >= 50 mL/min is required; methods of estimating GFR that can be used for this confirmation consist of a 12- or 24-hour urine creatinine clearance if the Schwartz formula or radioisotope method was used as the primary method or a radioisotope estimation of GFR if the Schwartz formula or urine creatinine clearance method was used as the primary method; if the confirmatory creatinine clearance is < 50 mL/min, then the patient is not eligible; if the confirmatory creatinine clearance is >= 50 mL/min, the patient is eligible
