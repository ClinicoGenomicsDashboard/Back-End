PROCUREMENT: Patients with active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive at time of procurement (can be pending at the time of blood draw)

Patients with known chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections should be excluded
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients
Patients that are known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible; note: inclusion of HIV positive patients will be considered at a later date
Patients with chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections should be excluded
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients (HIV testing will not be performed as a part of screening) on combination antiretroviral therapy are eligible for inclusion; the use of zidovudine is not allowed
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
Patients must not have known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis B or C infections
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus infection are not to be enrolled in the study
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C are excluded
Patients known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible

Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are excluded
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals are ineligible
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals are ineligible
Immunocompromised patients (other than that related to the primary oncologic diagnosis or to the use of corticosteroids) including patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive are not eligible
History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
Patients must not have a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection that is untreated and/or with a detectable viral load
Patients must not have known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection or known history of tuberculosis
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
No known evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, active infection, active bleeding diatheses, or renal transplant, including any patient known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be excluded; patients with HIV who have adequate CD4 count, not requiring antiretroviral medication, may be enrolled

Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C infections; testing to prove negative status is not required for enrollment unless it is deemed necessary for usual medical care of the patient
Patients must not have known history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the study chair
Other viral infections:* Known to have acute or chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection* Known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection* Prior therapy with viral-based tumor vaccine* Received live vaccine within 28 days prior to enrollment
Patients with other viral infections are ineligible:* Known to have acute or chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection* Known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection* Prior therapy with viral-based tumor vaccine* Received live vaccine within 28 days prior to enrollment
