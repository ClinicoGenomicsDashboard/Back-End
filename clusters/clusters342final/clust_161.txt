Patients must not have history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)
History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)
Central serous retinopathy (CSR) including presence of predisposing factors to RVO or CSR (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or a history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes); or visible pathology (e.g., evidence of optic disc cupping, evidence of new visual field defects on automated perimetry, or intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg as measured by tonography) as assessed by ophthalmic examination
Known ophthalmologic conditions, such as:* Current or past history of central serous retinopathy* Current or past history of retinal vein occlusion* Known intraocular pressure (IOP) > 21 mmHg (or ULN adjusted by age) or uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP); patients with known glaucoma and increased IOP who do not have meaningful vision (light perception only or no light perception) and are not experiencing pain related to the glaucoma, may be eligible after discussion with the study chair* Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination should be discussed with the study chair for potential eligibility* Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing orbito-temporal PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a significant abnormality for the purposes of the study
