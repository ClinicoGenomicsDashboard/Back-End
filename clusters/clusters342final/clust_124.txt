No overt renal, hepatic, cardiac or pulmonary disease
Patients with a significant intercurrent illness (any ongoing serious medical problem unrelated to cancer or its treatment) that is not covered by the detailed exclusion criteria and that is expected to interfere with the action of study agents or to significantly increase the severity of the toxicities experienced from study treatment are not eligible
Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), likely interfere with the study procedures or results
Patients must have adequate hepatic, hematologic and renal functioning to be able to be administered anastrozole at the discretion of the treating physician
While not an exclusion criterion, unless considered clinically indicated, patients should avoid taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the study medication; in particular, patients should avoid medications that are known to either induce or inhibit the activity of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4
Patients with more than 30% replacement of hepatic parenchyma by tumor or any history of drug related hepatic encephalopathy
Patients with any clinical significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction) that is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results
Patients must not have evidence of significant hematologic, renal, or hepatic dysfunction
Patients must not have evidence of significant intracranial hemorrhage
Patients with known significant active cardiovascular or pulmonary disease at the time of study entry are ineligible
Significant ST depression of >= 1.5 mm in 2 or more leads and/or T wave inversions in >= 2 leads
History or presence of clinically significant ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmias, or cardiac arrest
Clinically significant resting bradycardia
Currently active, clinically significant hepatic impairment (>= moderate hepatic impairment according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/Child Pugh classification
No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating investigator
Patients must not have known impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease
Patients with a history or presence of significant ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmia are excluded
The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:
Concurrent Illness* Patients with active autoimmune disease or documented history of autoimmune disease/syndrome that requires ongoing systemic steroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents, except ** Patients with vitiligo or resolved asthma/atopy** Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogrens syndrome * History of or ongoing pneumonitis or significant interstitial lung diseaseNote: This would include non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroid use* Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patients ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results* Patients with other current malignancies* Patients with known hypermutated brain tumors including those with CMMRD and Lynch syndrome are ineligible for enrollment in Strata A, B, D and E* Patients who have received a solid organ transplant
EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STRATUM C: Concurrent illness* Patients with active autoimmune disease or documented history of autoimmune disease/syndrome that requires ongoing systemic steroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents, except ** Patients with vitiligo or resolved asthma/atopy** Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogrens syndrome * History of or ongoing pneumonitis or significant interstitial lung disease* Note: This would include non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroid use* Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patients ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results** Exception to this is the presence of gastrointestinal polyps/adenomas and non-metastatic carcinomas, and history of any previous malignancies in patients with CMMRD which will be allowed in this study* Patients who have received a solid organ transplant
Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer
While not an exclusion criterion, unless clinically indicated, patients should avoid taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the study medications; in particular, patients should avoid medications that are known to either induce or inhibit the activity of hepatic microsomal isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4
Patients on tacrolimus or any other immunosuppressants with significant interaction with cisplatin
RECURRENT/ PROGRESSIVE DIPG (STRATUM 1): Patients have any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the ability of the patient to tolerate protocol therapy or put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results
NON-PROGRESSED DIPG (STRATUM 2): Patients have any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the ability of the patient to tolerate protocol therapy or put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results
Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the patients ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results
Patients with pacemaker, defibrillator, or documented significant arrhythmia, are not allowed
Patients may not have any clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the following:* Myocardial infarction or ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months* Major conduction abnormality (unless a cardiac pacemaker is present)* Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g., shortness of breath, chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with or without stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule out corrected QT (QTc) prolongation; the patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the discretion of the principal investigator; patients with underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction should be excluded from the study
NO hepatic artery embolization or cryoablation/radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastasis within 2 months of study treatment start
Any clinically significant electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, should be corrected before treatment
Any condition which in the investigators opinion deems the participant an unsuitable candidate to receive study drug. (i.e., any significant medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that would increase the patients risk by participating in this study)
