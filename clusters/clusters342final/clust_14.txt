No history of major surgery =< 14 days prior to registration
No history of major surgery =< 28 days of registration
At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient underwent any major surgery (eg.

Ibrutinib must be discontinued 7 days before (when possible) until 7 days after major surgery, and 3 days before (when possible) until 3 days after minor surgery; thus, patients to be enrolled on an ibrutinib trial must have completed major surgery > 7 days before initiating treatment, and/or must have completed minor surgery > 3 days before initiating treatment
Major surgery within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug
Patients who are less than 4 weeks post-operative (op) after major surgery
Patients must not have had major surgery within 28 days prior to registration or be scheduled for surgery during the projected course of protocol treatment; tumor biopsy is allowed
No major surgery within 21 days of registration with stabilization or resolution of surgical adverse events
Have had recent major surgery within a minimum of 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment, with the exception of surgical placement for vascular access
No major surgery =< 7 days prior to registration and no minor surgery =< 3 days prior to registration (with the exception of intravenous access placement, e.g. Hickman or peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC])

Major surgery within 21 days of starting protocol treatment
Major surgery within 30 days prior or during the study period
Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require major surgery during the course of the study
Patients may have received prior surgery; at least 28 days must have elapsed since surgery and patient must have recovered from any adverse effects of surgery
Ibrutinib should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery, depending upon the type of surgery and risk of bleeding
At least 4 weeks since major surgery or radiation therapy
Inability to safely delay surgery by 8 weeks as per surgeons discretion
No prior bariatric surgery or planning to undergo this procedure within the next 2 years after study registration
PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY CRITERIA: Patients must not have had a major surgery within 28 days prior to registration; patients must have recovered from any adverse effects of prior surgery to the satisfaction of the treating physician; biopsies and central IV access placement are not considered major surgery
Patients must be enrolled on ALTE07C1 prior to enrollment on ACNS1422* Patients must be enrolled within 36 days of definitive diagnostic surgery (day 0)** Note: patients must begin treatment within 36 days of definitive surgery
Patients who are not candidates for major abdominal surgery due to known medical comorbidities
Major surgery within 4 weeks before randomization
Patients must have recovered from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy; at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient underwent any major surgery (e.g., major: laparotomy, laparoscopy); there is no delay required for minor procedures (e.g., tumor fine-needle aspiration [FNA] or core biopsy, venous access device placement)
No major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization
Have had recent major surgery within a minimum of 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment, with the exception of surgical placement for vascular access
