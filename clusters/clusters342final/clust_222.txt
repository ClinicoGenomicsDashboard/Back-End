Patients with a pre-existing thyroid abnormality who are unable to maintain thyroid function in the normal range with medication are ineligible
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) =< 1.5 times ULN, within 30 days prior to enrollment
Adequate thyroid function within 28 days prior to registration defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in normal range
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits (WNL); supplementation is acceptable to achieve a TSH WNL; in patients with abnormal TSH if free T4 is normal and patient is clinically euthyroid, patient is eligible
Re-registration: TSH WNL; supplementation is acceptable to achieve a TSH WNL; in patients with abnormal TSH, if free T4 is normal and patient is clinically euthyroid, patient is eligible
Adequately controlled thyroid function, with no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits
Adequately controlled thyroid function, with no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits
Adequately controlled thyroid function, with no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction; elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal T3 and T4 are allowed; patients on thyroid replacement therapy are allowed
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within institutional limits (ie: normal); if TSH is greater or less than institutional limits patients may participate if their T4 is within normal limits (WNL); patients may be on a stable dose of replacement thyroid medication; dose adjustments are allowed if needed
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits (WNL); supplementation is acceptable to achieve a TSH WNL; in patients with abnormal TSH however if the Free T4 is normal and patient is clinically euthyroid, patient is eligible
Patients must have adequate thyroid function, as evidenced by either thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or, free thyroxine (T4) serum tests demonstrating values within the normal range, within 28 days prior to registration; Note: TSH, with reflex T4 is allowable if per institutional standard; otherwise, both TSH and free-T4 must be obtained
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits (TSH < ULN allowed in euthyroid patients on thyroid replacement therapy)
Adequately controlled thyroid function, with no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction; patients can be on thyroid hormone replacement medication; asymptomatic patients with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal T4/T3 are allowed to enroll, and recommended to follow with routine thyroid function test especially if they are randomized to cediranib/olaparib arm
Adequately controlled thyroid function, with no symptoms of thyroid dysfunction; patients can be on thyroid hormone replacement medication; asymptomatic patients with elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal T4/T3 are allowed to enroll, and recommended to follow with routine thyroid function test
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits (WNL); supplementation is acceptable to achieve a TSH WNL; in patients with abnormal TSH, if free T4 is normal and patient is clinically euthyroid, patient is eligible
A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) must be obtained within 28 days prior to step 2 registration to obtain a baseline value
Patients must have a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with reflex free T3/free T4 (if TSH is out of normal range) and electrocardiogram (EKG) obtained within 7 days prior to sub-study registration
