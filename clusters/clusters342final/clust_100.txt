Newly diagnosed and =< 3 months from surgical diagnosis; patients are also eligible if they have had a prior surgical procedure > 3 months earlier for low grade glioma, as long as the patient has not received prior radiation or prior chemotherapy
Histological evidence of World Health Organization (WHO) grade III anaplastic glioma or WHO grade II low grade glioma with locally diagnosed combined 1p/19q loss and the presence of an either IDH1 or IDH2, both as established by a local or referenced laboratory qualified for the study* Note: mixed gliomas are eligible, regardless of the degree of astrocytic or oligodendrocytic predominance, as long as the tumor is also co-deleted for 1p and 19q
History of prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy for glioma; note: patients who have a history of prior low grade glioma (with or without a distant history of prior surgery for that glioma), but who have never received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the glioma are eligible for the study
Patients with a diagnosis of spinal cord ependymoma, myxopapillary ependymoma, subependymoma, ependymoblastoma, or mixed glioma are NOT eligible
Patients with pontine glioma are not eligible
Patient must have one of the following: * For stratum 5: non NF-1 associated low grade glioma (LGG) (other than pilocytic astrocytoma or optic pathway glioma) * For stratum 1 or 2: non NF-1, non-optic pathway pilocytic astrocytoma; note: all patients with non NF-1 associated optic pathway glioma with or without tissue must be enrolled on stratum 4
Patients with sporadic (non NF-1 associated), histologically diagnosed progressive, recurrent or refractory non-optic pathway pilocytic astrocytoma who have pre- treatment tumor tissue available for BRAF analysis
NF-1 patients with radiographic evidence of a progressive, recurrent or refractory low grade glioma, with or without pre-treatment tumor tissue
Patients with progressive, recurrent or refractory optic pathway glioma, with or without pre-treatment tumor tissue
Patients with histologically diagnosed progressive, recurrent or refractory non NF-1 associated LGG (other than pilocytic astrocytoma or optic pathway glioma); these patients must have BRAF aberrations as documented by the Lindeman and Ligon Labs at Brigham and Womens Hospital using the same procedures
Patients will be assigned to one of 6 strata prior to enrollment; all BRAF assessments used for stratification below must be done at the Lindeman and Ligon Labs at Brigham and Womens Hospital using the same procedures as described in this protocol; assessments for both BRAF V^600E mutation and BRAF KIAA1549 fusion are required for patients who will enroll on strata 1, 2 and 5 * Stratum 1: patients with non NF-1 associated progressive, recurrent or refractory pilocytic astrocytoma with pre-trial tumor material available and with a BRAF aberration i.e. BRAFV^600E mutation and/or BRAF KIAA1549 fusion as determined by IHC and FISH, respectively; patients with optic pathway glioma are excluded* Stratum 2: patients with non NF-1 associated progressive, recurrent or refractory pilocytic astrocytoma with pre-trial tumor material available and without a BRAF aberration i.e. BRAF^V600E mutation and/or BRAF KIAA1549 fusion as determined by IHC and FISH, respectively; patients with optic pathway glioma are excluded* Stratum 3: patients with neuro-fibromatosis 1 (NF-1) associated progressive, recurrent or refractory low grade glioma (World Health Organization [WHO] grade I & II), with or without tissue* Stratum 4*: patients with non-NF1 associated progressive, recurrent or refractory optic pathway glioma with or without tissue available for BRAF evaluation* Stratum 5: patients with non NF-1 associated progressive, recurrent or refractory low grade glioma other than pilocytic astrocytoma or optic pathway glioma with a documented BRAF aberration identified in pre-trial tumor material* Stratum 6: patients with non-NF-1 associated progressive, recurrent or refractory low grade glioma (other than optic pathway glioma [OPG]) with tissue available for BRAF analyses who cannot be classified into stratum 1, 2 or 5 due to inadequate tissue quality, assay failure, etc**Clarification: Stratum 4 was specifically designed for patients with hypothalamic/optic pathway gliomas; the intent is that if there is any optic chiasm invasion regardless of where the tumor is originating from (chiasm vs. hypothalamus vs. other location), the patient should be enrolled on Stratum 4, regardless of whether the tumor has been biopsied or not; obviously, there are some tumors that include part of the hypothalamus and clearly do NOT include the chiasm at all; in these situations, and if the tumor is a biopsy proven pilocytic astrocytoma, these patients should be enrolled on Stratum 1 or 2 (depending upon BRAF status)
Patients must have recurrence or progression of their low-grade glioma after coming off treatment with AZD6244 on PBTC-029 or PBTC-029B, with or without having received additional anti-tumor therapy following discontinuation of AZD6244; the progression must be unequivocal and sufficient to warrant re-treatment in the opinion of the investigator; progression will be defined as either progressive disease (PD) that meets the study definitions of progressive disease by MRI or vision deterioration thought to be related to tumor in patients with optic pathway tumors
Evidence of an optic glioma, malignant glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, or other cancer requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy
Patients must have histologically confirmed supratentorial high grade glioma (grade III or IV glioma) that is progressive or recurrent following radiation therapy and chemotherapy; patients with grade IV glioma must have progressed or recurred after initial treatment with radiation and temozolomide; patients with grade III glioma must have received at least radiation and one regimen of chemotherapy (temozolomide or procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine [PCV] regimen)
Stratum A, currently closed to enrollment: Patients must have a recurrent, progressive or refractory DIPG following radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy* Histologic diagnosis is not required for patients with typical imaging findings of DIPG (defined as patients with a diffuse expansile mass centered in and involving at least 2/3 of the pons); patients with brainstem tumors who have undergone biopsy with a diagnosis of high-grade glioma or diffuse infiltrating glioma are also eligible
Stratum B: Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a non-brainstem high-grade glioma (NB-HGG) that is recurrent, progressive or refractory following therapy which included radiotherapy; spinal primary disease is eligible
EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STRATUM C: Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine or other brainstem high-grade glioma and those with primary spinal cord tumors
May not have a NF1 related tumor such as optic pathway glioma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, which requires treatment with chemotherapy or surgery
Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of supratentorial high-grade glioma or supratentorial ependymoma that is recurrent, progressive or refractory
May not have a NF1 related tumor such as optic pathway glioma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, which requires treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery
Patients with low grade glioma are not eligible
