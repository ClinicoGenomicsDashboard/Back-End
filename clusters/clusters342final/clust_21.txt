Measurable disease is defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1); measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI

All patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one target lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI; all imaging studies must be performed within 28 days prior to registration
Patients must have measurable disease (lesion in previously irradiated field could be considered as measurable if progressive at inclusion) defined as per RECIST v1.1 with at least one lesion that can be measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan
All patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
Patients must have radiographically measurable disease defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 20 mm with conventional techniques or as > 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; lesions in previously irradiated anatomic areas (external beam radiation) cannot be considered target lesions unless there has been documented growth of those lesions after radiotherapy
All patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
All patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI

Patients must have at least one measurable CNS lesion that is asymptomatic, untreated, and does not require local therapy at the time of enrollment; measurable CNS disease is defined as a brain metastasis that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 5 mm (>= 0.5 cm) with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); if the lesion is 5-10 mm in size and is the only measurable disease, MRI imaging must be performed with 1.5 mm slice thickness or less; a history of previously treated brain metastases is allowed, however any lesion present at the time of whole brain radiotherapy or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 2 mm of the treated lesion) will NOT be considered untreated unless it is new or documented to have progressed unequivocally since treatment
