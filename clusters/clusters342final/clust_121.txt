Patients with uncontrolled seizures
Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants and if seizures are well controlled
Patients who are currently receiving enzyme inducing anticonvulsants are not eligible
Patients must not have a history of seizures
Patients must not have received enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants including phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, or carbamazepine for at least 7 days prior to study enrollment; patients receiving non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants such as gabapentin or levetiracetam will be eligible
Patients with uncontrolled seizures
Patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) are not eligible for treatment on this protocol; patients may be on non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs or not be taking any anti-epileptic drugs; patients previously treated with EIAED may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to the first dose of AZD1775 (MK-1775)
TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients with history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases who have received treatment and who either have not had seizures or have been on stable doses of anti-seizure medicine and had no seizures for 4 weeks will be eligible; enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are contraindicated
TREATMENT: Patients with a history of seizures are not eligible to receive veliparib, but patients with a history of CNS metastases who have received treatment and who either have not had seizures or have been on stable doses of anti-seizure medicine and had no seizures for >= 4 weeks will be eligible for other study agents; enzyme inducing anticonvulsants are contraindicated
TREATMENT: Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial; patients who have a history of seizures are not eligible to receive veliparib, but patients who have either not had seizures or who have been on stable doses of anti-seizure medicine and had no seizures for 4 weeks will be eligible for other study agents; enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are contraindicated
Patients must not currently be receiving enzyme inducing anticonvulsants
Patients must not have received enzyme inducing anticonvulsants for at least 14 days prior to enrollment
Comorbid conditions: patients are unable to participate due to the following:* Generalized or partial seizure disorder that is uncontrolled at the time of registration; the definition of controlled generalized seizures is patients must be on a stable dose of anti-seizure medication and without generalized seizures for at least 10 days prior to registration; the definition of controlled partial seizures is patients must be on a stable dose of anti-seizure medication for at least 10 days prior to registration; patients with occasional breakthrough partial seizures are allowed at treating physicians discretion* Grade 3 or 4 thromboembolic disease within 6 months (mo) of registration* Known history of prolonged QT syndrome
Patients who require enzyme inducing anti-convulsants to control seizures
Patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) are not eligible for treatment on this protocol; patients may be on non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs or not be taking any anti-epileptic drugs; patients previously treated with EIAED may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to the first dose of MLN0128 (TAK-228)
Concurrent use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED); patients may be on non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs or not be taking any anti-epileptic drugs; patients previously treated with EIAED may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to the first dose of MLN0128
Intractable seizures while on adequate anticonvulsant therapymore than 1 seizure per month for the past 2 months
Patients with uncontrolled seizures defined as seizures that require regular use of rescue medications or in the opinion of the investigator require increasing doses of anti-epileptic medications or would compromise the ability to tolerate study therapy or interfere with protocol therapy or procedures; patients with seizures that are well controlled are eligible and may be on antiepileptic medications if on a stable dose
EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STRATUM C: Patients with uncontrolled seizures defined as seizures that require regular use of rescue medications or in the opinion of the investigator require increasing doses of antiepileptic medications or would compromise the ability to tolerate study therapy or interfere with protocol therapy or procedures; patients with seizures that are well controlled are eligible and may be on antiepileptic medications if on a stable dose
Seizures within the past 12 months before enrollment
For patients with CNS tumors, any baseline neurologic deficit, including seizures, must be stable for at least one week prior to initiating study treatment
Patients with a known seizure disorder who are receiving non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants and have well-controlled seizures may be enrolled
Patients must not have received enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants for at least 7 days prior to enrollment
Patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) are not eligible for treatment on this protocol; patients may be on non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs or not be taking any anti-epileptic drugs; patients previously treated with EIAED may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to the first dose of PT2385
