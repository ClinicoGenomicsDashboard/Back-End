Patients must have histologically confirmed localized high grade (G3) transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial carcinoma) of the bladder that is stage Ta, T1, and/or carcinoma in situ (CIS) confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI) 90 days prior to study entry; this can be obtained at an outside hospital prior to entry into the study or at the NCI; however, all outside pathology specimens will require that the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues be re-read by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI; for patients enrolled at collaborating trial sites, diagnosis must be confirmed by the Department of Pathology at the institution where the patient is enrolled on the trial; pathology can also be reviewed by the Laboratory of Pathology at the NCI if the participating trial site prefers another pathologic evaluation
Eligible patients must have histopathologically confirmed myxoid liposarcoma with confirmation of DDIT3 rearrangement
One of the following chemosensitive histologies as defined in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of soft tissue tumors (with some evidence of good response to chemoradiation and of sufficient high risk of metastases, or clear evidence of metastases):* Unclassified soft tissue sarcomas that are too undifferentiated to be placed in a specific pathologic category in the WHO classification (often called undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma or soft tissue sarcoma not otherwise specified [NOS])* Synovial sarcoma* Angiosarcoma of soft tissue* Adult fibrosarcoma* Mesenchymal (extraskeletal) chondrosarcoma* Leiomyosarcoma* Liposarcoma (excluding myxoid liposarcoma)* Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma* Embryonal sarcoma of the liver
Patients with the following histologies are only eligible for the chemotherapy cohort and cannot enroll on the non-chemotherapy cohort:* Unclassified soft tissue sarcomas that are too undifferentiated to be placed in a specific pathologic category in the WHO classification (often called undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma or soft tissue sarcoma NOS) in patients < 30 years of age* Synovial sarcoma* Embryonal sarcoma of the liver
Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma by central review, except if the diagnosis was already confirmed by the RRePS (Rseau de Rfrence en Pathologie des Sarcomes et des Tissus Mous et des Viscres) network
Patients must have histologically confirmed bone or soft tissue sarcoma by central pathology review* Patients must have histologically confirmed liposarcoma (LPS) (only dedifferentiated and pleomorphic; well differentiated not eligible), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)/malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), or gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
Histologically confirmed high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube malignancy that is metastatic and for which curative measures do not exist; pathology must be reviewed and confirmed at Mayo Clinic Department of Pathology; the histology can be confirmed from tissue that was taken at the time of diagnosis; a biopsy at the time of recurrence prior to enrollment on study is not required
Patients of any age must have histologically or cytologically confirmed embryonal or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI)
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed alveolar soft part sarcoma that is not curable by surgery; diagnosis of malignancy must be confirmed by the department of pathology at the institution where the patient is enrolled prior to patient enrollment
Newly diagnosed and histopathologically confirmed (by central pathology review) potentially resectable soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity and trunk of the following subtypes: liposarcoma (excluding myxoid liposarcoma), leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma* An incisional or core biopsy is the preferred method for diagnosis; fine needle aspiration is not acceptable* Sites permissible for biopsy include** Extremities: upper (including shoulder) and lower (including hip)** Trunk: body wall
Patients must have histologically confirmed grade 2 or 3 tumors by the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group (FNCLCC) sarcoma grading system
The patient must have a newly diagnosed unifocal intracranial meningioma, gross totally resected, and histologically confirmed as WHO grade II based upon pathology findings at the enrolling institution; WHO grade will be assigned according to WHO 2016 criteria
Histologically confirmed diagnosis of WHO grade II meningioma confirmed by central pathology review prior to step 2 registration
