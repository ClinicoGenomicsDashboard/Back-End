Any degree of prior treatment is allowed, including other anti-angiogenic treatments (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 [VEGFR2] inhibitors or bevacizumab); patients with no prior therapy are eligible, provided they have metastatic disease that is not curable by surgery
Patients must not have received prior treatment with any VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (e.g., cediranib, sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib); however, prior treatment with bevacizumab is allowed
For stage 2 GBM participants, no prior treatment with bevacizumab/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors; prior treatment with bevacizumab/VEGFR inhibitors is allowed in stage 1 for all participants, as well as stage 2 endometrial and ovarian cancer participants
Patients may not have received prior treatment affecting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway (including, but not limited to thalidomide, sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and nintedanib); bevacizumab used in the upfront setting in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or as maintenance to treat newly diagnosed disease will be allowed
Patients may not have had a prior anti-angiogenic agent in the recurrent setting; prior use of bevacizumab in the upfront or upfront maintenance setting is allowed
Prior treatment affecting the VEGF/VEGFR pathway or the angiopoietin pathway in the recurrent setting, including but not limited to thalidomide, bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, cediranib, nintedanib, and trebananib; bevacizumab used in the upfront setting in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or as maintenance to treat newly diagnosed disease will be allowed
No bevacizumab =< 3 months of study registration
Prior bevacizumab therapy is excluded.
Progression of disease assessed by local site using Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, with plan to administer bevacizumab, either as single therapy or in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic regimens, in order to treat tumor progression/recurrence per the treating physician; patients receiving bevacizumab primarily for reduction of edema (i.e. alleviation of symptoms) rather than for tumor treatment are excluded
Patients who have not previously received a bevacizumab-containing regimen (i.e., this must be the first bevacizumab-containing therapy administered to the patient)
Patient must be scheduled to receive treatment with a bevacizumab containing chemotherapy regimen; patient can be treated with bevacizumab alone or in combination with other chemotherapies; patient may also be receiving treatment with Optune
Prior treatment with agents targeting the VEGF pathway, including bevacizumab
Participants may not have had prior use of PARP inhibitors; patients may not have received prior treatment affecting the VEGF pathway including but not limited to thalidomide, bevacizumab, sunitinib, or sorafenib
Patients must not have received prior anti-VEGF therapy including bevacizumab (i.e. patients must be bevacizumab naive)
Patients may have received previous NY ESO 1 vaccine therapy; patients who received bevacizumab or other experimental therapies are eligible for enrollment provided they have discontinued therapy (at least 4 weeks) prior to randomization and recovered from toxicities to less than grade 2
