If primary disease in the thoracic cavity was previously treated with local therapy in the form of surgery, any local/regional disease recurrence should be technically treatable with SBRT or hypofractionated radiation after induction systemic therapy.
If a patient has progressed in previous areas of primary disease that received definitive doses of radiation, these patients would require re-irradiation in previous high dose anatomic areas and are not eligible for this study.
Patients on supraphysiologic doses of steroids or use of such within the previous six weeks
Patients with evidence of another malignancy or benign tumor requiring chemotherapy or radiation therapy are excluded; however, those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma requiring treatment will be eligible as selumetinib has documented activity in plexiform neurofibromas
Patients must have at least one lesion that has not previously been irradiated (and is not within a previously radiated field) and for which palliative radiation is potentially indicated and could be safely delivered at the radiation doses specified in this protocol; this lesion must not be the only measurable lesion so that it is still possible to determine the response rate outside of the radiation treatment field; this lesion must not be within the central nervous system (CNS) (brain or spinal cord) or requiring urgent or emergent palliative radiation given the timing of radiation specified on this protocol; furthermore, this lesion: * For cohort 1 (NSCLC cohort)  the lesion to be irradiated must be in the lung, lymph nodes, adrenal gland or liver * For cohort 2 (colorectal cohort)  the lesion to be irradiated must be in the liver
