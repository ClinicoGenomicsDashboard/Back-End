History of another malignancy* Exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3 years, or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible; consult the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Medical Monitor if unsure whether second malignancies meet the requirements specified above
History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3 years (depending upon tumor type studied or clinical setting, 3 or 5 years can be used; e.g., for advanced melanoma and pancreatic studies 3 years is more appropriate due to aggressiveness of the disease, while 5 years can be more appropriate for prostate or ovarian cancer or adjuvant setting when life expectancy is longer), or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible; consult the CTEP medical monitor if unsure whether second malignancies meet the requirements specified above; exception: patients with history of RAS mutation-positive tumors are not eligible regardless of interval from the current study; prospective RAS testing is not required; however, if the results of previous RAS testing are known, they must be used in assessing eligibility
Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within the last three years

History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3 years, or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or any carcinoma in situ and/or patients with indolent second malignancies, are eligible; consult the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) medical monitor if unsure whether second malignancies meet the requirements
History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3 years, patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer, and/or patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible; MSK can consult the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Medical Monitor if unsure whether second malignancies meet the requirements specified above
No history of TNBC invasive breast cancer within 5 years of enrollment, no concurrent malignancies of any sort
Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within the last three years (2 years for breast cancer); patients are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy
Patients with other active invasive malignancies will be excluded; patients with prior malignancies will be excluded (except [1] non-melanoma skin cancer or prior in situ carcinoma of the cervix; [2] patients with other invasive malignancies who had [or have] cancer present within the last five years)
