Tumor tissue that is determined by central pathology review prior to step 2 registration to be of sufficient quantity for central analysis of MGMT status
Patients must have paraffin tissue from the diagnostic or relapse biopsy available to be submitted for central pathology review and integral molecular subtyping; this review is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility and should be initiated as soon as possible; determination of cell-of-origin subtype will be performed using the lymphoma subtyping test (LST) assay
Determination of activated B-celllike (ABC) subtype by pre-registration central review
Presence of cavitation of central pulmonary lesion
CT scans or MRIs used to assess disease at baseline must be submitted for central review
Central imaging real-time review (72 hour turn around) to confirm eligibility (for institutions that opt to utilize central imaging review to confirm eligibility)
Histologically proven diagnosis of salivary cancer by central pathology review
AR expression detected by immunohistochemistry by central review
Patients must have slides available for submission to central pathology review; this review is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility and proper cohort assignment* HISTOLOGIC COHORT 1: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (includes: malignant fibrous histiocytoma, myxofibrosarcoma, high grade sarcoma not otherwise specified [NOS])* HISTOLOGIC COHORT 2: Leiomyosarcoma (either uterine or extra-uterine)* HISTOLOGIC COHORT 3: Other (either malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor or synovial sarcoma); during the phase II portion of the study, enrollment will be limited to maximum of 25 patients in this cohort** Note that the phase I is limited to the histologic subtypes listed above; since patients will be enrolling onto dose cohorts during the phase I, they will not enroll onto specific histologic cohorts, although the histologic subtype informed will be collected during patient enrollment
Histologic documentation: Eligible patients must have histopathologically confirmed sarcoma of one of the subtypes listed, by central review
Patients must be newly diagnosed and have a confirmed molecular diagnosis of classical histologic type (non large cell/anaplastic [LC/A]) WNT medulloblastoma from rapid central pathology screening review on APEC14B1 (immunohistochemistry [IHC]/molecular screening [positive nuclear beta (B)-catenin by IHC and positive for catenin beta 1 [CTNNB1] mutation) and confirmation of =< 1.5 cm^2 maximal cross-sectional area of residual tumor from rapid central imaging review
Confirmation of radiographic stage as borderline resectable disease by real-time Alliance central radiographic review
Patients must have specimens available and institutions must be planning to submit for centralized pathology review and for integrated translational medicine objectives
For patients with oropharyngeal cancer only: the institution will do p16 testing, and if p16 is negative, this tissue must be submitted for central review for confirmation before Step 2 registration; note: if the institution finds that the patient is p16 positive, the patient is excluded from this trial on the basis of distinct biology, prognosis, and low- or intermediate-risk rather than high-risk status
For patients with oropharyngeal cancer only: p16 negative, confirmed by central pathology review
Patients must have had all visible tumor resected completely within 60 days prior to registration; CIS disease is not expected to be completely excised; all patients must have tumor tissue from the histologic diagnosis of recurrence available for central pathology review submission; failure to submit these materials will make the patient ineligible for this study
For patients enrolled on AALL08B1 or APEC14B1 (if open for ALL patients) prior to enrollment on AALL1631, the required diagnostic bone marrow sample has been fulfilled* For patients who have not previously enrolled on AALL08B1 or APEC14B1 (if open for ALL patients) prior to enrollment on AALL1631, a baseline diagnostic sample must be available to develop an MRD probe* In addition, laboratory reports detailing evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion must be submitted for rapid central review within 72 hours of study enrollment
NOTE: Central pathology review must occur between steps 1 and 2 of registration; once appropriate pathology specimens are received, central pathology review will occur within 15 days, and must confirm WHO grade II meningioma before the patient can proceed to step 2 registration and randomization
Patients must have a histologically proven diagnosis of endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma by endometrial curettage or biopsy within 8 weeks prior to registration; central pathology review will be required as part of the study but not for registration purposes
Newly diagnosed patients must have histologic verification of a primary extracranial germ cell tumor in any of the categories outlined; elevation of serum tumor markers without histologic confirmation is not sufficient for entry on the trial* NOTE: for low risk patients, materials for rapid surgical central review must be sent within 7 days of study enrollment
Tumor tissue must be available for submission for central pathology review
