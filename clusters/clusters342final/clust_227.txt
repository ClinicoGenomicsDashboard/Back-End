Tissue blocks or slides must be sent if available, with exclusions; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the study chair must be notified prior to study enrollment
For patients enrolling on Part B: tissue blocks or slides must be sent; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the Study Chair must be notified prior to enrollment
Patients must have tumor tissue from transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) available for submission that is sufficient for COXEN testing and must agree to submission of 20 (10 micron) slides of formal-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, with 2 (5 micron) slides at the start and end of the 20 slides, for a total of 22 unstained slides; the diagnostic TURBT sample must have been obtained within 56 days prior to registration; all sections should be placed on plus slides, as is the standard procedure in most pathology units
Patients must consent, if residual tumor is present at the time of cystectomy, to the submission of 20 (10 micron) unstained slides with 2 (5 micron) slides at the start and stop of the series (total of 22 unstained slides)
Tissue blocks or slides must be sent for all patients; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the study chair must be notified prior to enrollment
Part C: Archived paraffin-embedded tissue (20 unstained slides or a tumor block) from a prior resection must be available as a control for correlative studies; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the study chair must be notified prior to enrollment
The pathology report and either (1) tissue (blocks or an unstained slides) or (2) a photomicrograph of the ER IHC slides from at least one site of metastatic disease and/or from primary breast cancer must be available for central review and analysis* NOTE: if photomicrographs are submitted, the submission of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), PR and Ki67 IHCs, if performed, are also to be submitted
Tissue blocks or slides must be sent; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the study chair must be notified prior to enrollment
Tissue blocks or slides must be sent if available; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the study chair must be notified prior to study enrollment
Archival tissue of tumors (slides or blocks [blocks preferred]) must be available for analysis; If tissue is not available, patients willing to undergo a pre-treatment biopsy may enroll
Tissue blocks or slides must be sent for all patients; if tissue blocks or slides are unavailable, the study chair must be notified prior to enrollment
