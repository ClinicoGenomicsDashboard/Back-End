Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); these medications must have been started 1 month prior to enrollment on this study; in addition, men receiving treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of testosterone by continuation of luteinizing-releasing hormone agonists
Previous hormonal therapy, such as LHRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, triptorelin) or LHRH antagonist (e.g. degarelix), anti-androgens (e.g., flutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate), estrogens (e.g., diethylstilbestrol [DES]), or surgical castration (orchiectomy)
Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); in addition, men receiving treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of testosterone by continuation of luteinizing-releasing hormone agonists
NOTE: use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (e.g., leuprolide or goserelin) is not allowed
The participant has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 4 weeks or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer, before the first dose of study treatment; note: participants with prostate cancer currently receiving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists may be maintained on these agents
Prior orchiectomy or must be on ongoing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist (e.g., degarelix) therapy
Testosterone =< 50 ng/dL (documented at any time while on LHRH agonist or antagonists or s/p orchiectomy)
Patients on bisphosphonates for any cancer or on hormone therapy for prostate cancer will not need to discontinue this therapy to be eligible; however, patients with prostate cancer will need to have metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed despite hormonal therapy; castrate testosterone levels occur within hours after castration and within 2 to 3 weeks of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist; the current standard is to continue androgen suppression despite progressive disease
Patients with prostate cancer can continue to receive treatment with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists while on study, as long as there is evidence of disease progression on therapy
TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients with bone metastases or hypercalcemia on intravenous bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab, or similar agents areare eligible to participate and may continue this treatment; patients with prostate cancer may continue luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antagonists
TREATMENT: Patients with bone metastases or hypercalcemia on intravenous bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab, or similar agents are eligible to participate and may continue this treatment; patients with prostate cancer may continue LHRH agonists or antagonists
Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery other than that specified in this protocol is not allowed; luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and adjuvant bisphosphonate or denosumab use is allowed
Receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor (including investigational kinase inhibitor) within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment; note: subjects with prostate cancer currently receiving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists may be maintained on these agents
The subject has received prior treatment with hormonal therapy within 14 days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer, before the first dose of study treatment; subjects receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists are allowed to participate
Receiving any other therapies for cancer treatment (with the exception of gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonists for prostate cancer); Note: hydroxyurea is allowed before initiation of study treatment and for the first 5 days of study treatment
Has received adjuvant endocrine therapy (selective estrogen receptor modulator [SERM] alone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] analogue plus SERM or aromatase inhibitors [AI]) for >= 18 months but =< 30 months for early breast cancer* Note: patients who have received neo/adjuvant endocrine treatment within a clinical trial and patients who have received pharmaco-prevention are eligible
Prior androgen deprivation (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist and/or non-steroidal anti-androgen) is allowed if discontinued at least 90 days prior to study enrollment and given for =< 90 days duration* For example: Patients on prior LHRH analogs (post-prostatectomy), the discontinuation date should be calculated based on the expected duration of the sustained release injection, not simply the injection date of the drug; for instance, if a 22.5 mg sustained release dose of leuprolide acetate is given (3 month duration), then the expected duration of such a dose would be 90 days after the injection date; for a 7.5 mg leuprolide (1 month duration), the discontinuation date would be 30 days after the injection date* Please note: Finasteride or dutasteride must be stopped before treatment but should not determine eligibility
Patients must have histologically confirmed progressive, metastatic castration resistant prostate adenocarcinoma by meeting ALL the following:* Pathology of prostate gland or metastatic disease must confirm the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma; mixed histology with other variants including but not limited to small cell or neuroendocrine differentiation must be discussed with the study principal investigator (PI) * Metastasis must be documented by radiographic evidence* Castration resistance must be documented with surgical or medical castration with serum testosterone < 50 ng/d (< 2.0 nM); if the patient is being treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (patient who has not undergone orchiectomy), this therapy must have been initiated at least 4 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1 and must be continued throughout the study* Progression must be evidenced and documented by any of the following parameters** Two consecutively rising PSA values, above the baseline, at a minimum of 1-week intervals; the minimal value to enter the study is 1.0 ng/ml or greater; the reference value (#1) is the last PSA measured before increases are documented, with subsequent values obtained a minimum of 1 week apart; if the PSA at time point 3 (value #3A) is greater than that at point 2, then eligibility has been met; if the PSA is not greater than point 2 (value #3B), but value #4 is, the patient is eligible assuming that other criteria are met, if values 3A or #4 are 1 ng/mL or higher (Prostate Cancer Working Group 3)** Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan** Progressive disease by RECIST 1.1
