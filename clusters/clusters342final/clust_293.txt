Direct tumor extension into the stomach, duodenum, small bowel or large bowel

The subject has evidence of tumor invading the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus, stomach, small or large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib
Patients must be able to tolerate oral medication and not have evidence of active bowel obstruction* Note: patients can have a history of prior bowel obstruction, provided the patient is not having symptoms of bowel obstruction at the time of enrolment and the bowel obstruction is not anticipated to recur during the participation in the study
Direct tumor extension into the stomach, duodenum, small bowel or large bowel
Patient must have malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) as evidenced by all of the following:* Clinical evidence of a small bowel obstruction (via history, physical, and radiographic examination)* Bowel obstruction below (distal to) ligament of Treitz* Intra-abdominal primary cancer with incurable disease
Patients must have malignant bowel obstruction due to an intra-abdominal primary cancer (i.e. gastrointestinal [GI], pancreas, ovarian, uterine, cervical, kidney, bladder, prostate, gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST] [all sites], and sarcoma); patients may still have primary tumor as long as it is not a primary large bowel obstruction from colorectal cancer
Patients must not have signs of bowel perforation necessitating surgery or acute abdomen evidenced by peritonitis on physical exam within 2 days prior to registration
Unable to swallow capsules, or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel, or symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction
The subject has evidence of tumor invading the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus, stomach, small or large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib
Lesions suspected to be at higher-risk for bleeding such as bowel involvement with tumor that invades into the bowel wall or involves the intraluminal component of bowel by imaging or direct visualization or central pulmonary lesions
The subject has evidence of tumor invading the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus, stomach, small or large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib
