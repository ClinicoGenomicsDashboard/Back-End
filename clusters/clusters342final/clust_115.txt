Patients must not have presence of class III or IV heart failure, according to New York Heart Association classifications, or a known left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%; Note: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) evaluation by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) is not required prior to registration

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment must be performed within 90 days prior to randomization; (LVEF assessment performed by 2-dimensional [D] echocardiogram is preferred; however, multi gated acquisition [MUGA] scan may be substituted based on institutional preferences;) the LVEF must be >= 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal
New York Heart Association class I or less; ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or angina pain; patients 60 years or older must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest >= 40% measured by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA)
Left ventricular ejection fraction of > 50% on baseline echocardiography or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan
Left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% on echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA)
