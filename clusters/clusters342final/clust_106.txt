Patients must have tissue available and must agree to submission of tissue and blood; one to two paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or 15-20 unstained slides are requested (a minimum of 12 slides is required); cytology (i.e. fine-needle aspirations, pleural effusion specimens) is acceptable if a cell block or sufficient unstained slides are available; tumor material must be reviewed by a local pathologist who must confirm that at least 100 viable tumor cells are present in the sample and sign the S1403 Pathology Review Form prior to registration; patients must also be willing to submit blood samples for correlative research at baseline, during treatment and at progression
Unless the pre-screening was performed at Yale Clinical Molecular Pathology Lab (YCMPL), patients must have TCC tumor tissue available for submission in a form of at least 10 unstained slides or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block (FFPE block highly recommended and preferred) along with a buccal swab; if the number of slides is less than 10, a biopsy should be considered; if a biopsy is deemed unsafe, the case may be discussed with the study principal investigator (PI) and approval must be given for eligibility
Patients must have adequate pre-trial formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor material available for use in the biology studies mutational analysis and genome wide sequencing for each stratum* Patients with DIPG who have tissue available are requested to submit similar tissue as patients in other strata; however, this is not required for eligibility
Patients must have a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor block OR 1 representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and 20 unstained sarcoma tissue slides available for submission to central pathology review; this review is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility
Availability of tissue for correlative studies; patients must have at least 6-8 unstained slides of archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue available; if not enough archived tissue is available, a fresh tumor biopsy prior to study initiation is mandatory; for patients who have undergone a fresh baseline biopsy at baseline, the archived tissue is not mandatory
Baseline tumor tissue, either fresh (preferred) or from paraffin block/unstained slides if contemporary biopsy is unsafe or not otherwise obtainable from the primary tumor site or metastatic site to be available for use on correlative studies
Confirmation of availability of FFPE tumor specimen with adequate tumor tissue (either one paraffin embedded tissue block OR 10 5-micron unstained slides from the block on regular (non-plus) slides and 1 hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] slide)

Patient must have archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimen from the original diagnostic biopsy available for submission to Adaptive Biotechnologies for ClonoSEQ ID molecular marker identification of unique clonal immunoglobulin deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence* NOTE: Patients for whom the molecular marker is identified will have peripheral blood collected after completion of induction (patients disease status is PR or CR) and submitted to Adaptive Biotechnologies for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment
Presence of deficient (d) DNA mismatch repair (dMMR); MMR status must be assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR protein expression (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) where loss of one or more proteins indicates dMMR; dMMR may be determined either locally or by site-selected reference lab; Note: loss of MLH1 and PMS2 commonly occur together; formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue is required for subsequent retrospective central confirmation of dMMR status
Patients must have a minimum of five, available unstained slides from the residual (post-neoadjuvant) invasive tumor in primary site or lymph node; (these will be submitted to determine PD-L1 expression) the tumor tissue must be adequate for PD-L1 testing, which typically requires a minimum of 100 cancer cells per slide* NOTE: Initial order for specimen kits should be placed at least two weeks prior to registering the first patient at each site
