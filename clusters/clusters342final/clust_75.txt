Patients who are currently receiving drugs that are strong or moderate inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) or sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range are not eligible; the use of aprepitant as an antiemetic is prohibited; caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of AZD1755 (MK-1775) and agents that are sensitive substrates of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8 (CYP2C8), 2C9 and 2C19, or substrates of this enzyme with narrow therapeutic ranges, as well as agents that are inhibitors or substrates of permeability glycoprotein (P-gp)
Patients taking the following prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products (i.e. grapefruit juice) are ineligible: sensitive cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) substrates, CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, moderate to potent inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4; patients would be eligible if the medications can be discontinued two weeks prior to day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study until 2 weeks after the last dose of study medication
