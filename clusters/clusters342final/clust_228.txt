Eligible patients in the dose escalation phases of the trial must agree to biopsies of normal skin, unless they undergo optional tumor biopsies; the mandatory biopsy requirement can be waived at the discretion of principal investigator in the event of any medical contraindication (e.g. lidocaine allergy); patients enrolled to the expanded cohorts must agree to tumor sampling; patients on anticoagulation must be able to hold warfarin or low molecular weight heparin for a sufficient amount of time to make skin and tumor biopsies safe to perform; PT/INR and PTT should be =< 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal prior to performance of skin or tumor biopsies, with values re-checked after the eligibility screen as medically indicated
Patients enrolling in the expansion cohorts must have disease amenable to biopsy and be willing to undergo pre-and post-treatment biopsies
Patient must agree to allow 3 separate biopsies of any malignant lesion; biopsies do not need to be done if:* Tumor is not considered accessible by either the investigator or the person performing the biopsy (it is determined the risk is too high due to location near vital organs or too great of a risk of an adverse event)* Patient is on anticoagulation and it would be unsafe to temporarily hold the anticoagulation* Consent of the principal investigator (PI) not to have a biopsy done* A minimum of 8 subjects must participate in the biopsy part of the study
For cohort 3 only, patients must be able to safely undergo pre and post-treatment biopsy, i.e., at least one readily accessible lesion or palpable lymph node metastasis arising from any solid tumor cancer or lymphoma* NOTE: this may include cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors using injection by palpation or ultrasound guidance* NOTE: the target lesion must be >= 1.5 cm on its longest diameter, be at least 5 mm thick, and have distinct borders* NOTE: deep seated lesion(s) that are deemed hazardous to inject or lesion(s) close to vital structures that might be impinged with tumor swelling are excluded as targeted tumor* NOTE: cohort 3 should be selected for patients with injectable cutaneous lesion(s), unless the patient elects not to receive IT injection and/or undergo pre and post-treatment biopsies
Patients must have disease amenable to biopsy and must be willing to undergo a paired biopsy for correlative analyses (the first biopsy within 28 days prior to start of treatment and the second biopsy while on treatment)
Patients must agree to undergo two separate biopsies of a malignant lesion; biopsies do not need to be done if one of the following apply:* If either the site investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the patient (if the only tumor accessible for biopsy is also the only lesion that can be used for RECIST v1.1 response evaluation, then the patient may be exempt from biopsy after discussion with the MSK principal investigator)* The goal will be to have a minimum of 6 patients from Cohort A and 3 patients from Cohort B attempt to have one or both of these research biopsies done (for a total of 9 patients total); accrual may be limited only to subjects for whom tumor is accessible for biopsy and attempt at biopsy is considered safe if continued enrollment of those who are not candidates for biopsy make it impossible to reach the accrual goals for research biopsies described above (e.g., if 19 [of 25] patients are accrued to Cohort A without any biopsies having been obtained within the cohort, then all further subjects who are registered to that cohort must qualify for attempted research biopsy in order to be enrolled into the study [i.e., subjects who would have been excluded from having biopsies done due to the above reasons would be excluded from participating in the study; these conditions also apply to Cohort B])
For enrollment in the first stage of Cohort B, patients must have accessible pre-treatment and post-treatment (4-6 weeks) tumor for biopsy
Patients must have a PN amenable to a percutaneous biopsy to participate in the biopsy portion of this study, and must be willing to undergo pre-, and on treatment tumor biopsies; there should be no contraindication for serial biopsies; NOTE: up to 10 patients who meet all criteria, but have PN which cannot be biopsied safely, will be eligible for the treatment portion of the study
FOR PATIENTS ENROLLED IN THE EXPANSION COHORT: willingness to undergo mandatory biopsies (day -14, approximately 4 hours post end of irinotecan infusion and day 1, approximately 4 hours post end of irinotecan infusion [= 3 hours post end of VX-970]); patients enrolled to this cohort should have tumors deemed easily accessible for biopsies with low likelihood of complication
Tumor amenable to biopsy and willingness to undergo tumor biopsies before and after M6620 (VX-970) treatment during the expansion phase of the trial (biopsies optional during the escalation phase)
During the expansion phase of the protocol, patients must have disease amenable to biopsy and be willing to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies
Patients in the expansion cohort undergoing tumor biopsies may not be on anticoagulants
Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be willing to have serial biopsies (with a third biopsy upon evidence of disease progression)
Disease suitable for assessment by pre- and post-biopsies
Must be agreeable to the mandatory research tumor biopsies (pre-treatment and on-treatment); tumor biopsies are mandatory at pre-treatment and at on-treatment; there is an optional biopsy at post-progression
Willingness to undergo a tumor biopsy
Subjects must be able and willing to undergo serial biopsies of injected lesion(s) and, when applicable and clinically feasible, non-injected lesions
Presence of biopsiable disease and patient able to undergo pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsy
