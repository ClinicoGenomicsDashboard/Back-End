Patients with intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding
The subject has experienced any of the following* Clinically-significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months before the first dose of study treatment; the participant must be maintained on a prophylactic regimen for management of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding event with no evidence of recurrence and/or endoscopic confirmation of resolution of the source of a lower GI bleed* Hemoptysis of >= 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red blood within 3 months before the first dose of study treatment* Any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the first dose of study treatment
No history of bleeding problems; not taking aspirin or any medication that may affect erythrocyte biochemistry
Subject has an underlying condition predisposing them to bleeding or currently exhibits signs of clinically significant bleeding
Subject has a recent history of non-chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenic-associated bleeding within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug
Subject has an underlying condition predisposing them to bleeding or currently exhibits signs of clinically significant bleeding
Subject has a recent history of non-chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenic-associated bleeding within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug
Known portal hypertension or history of variceal bleeding
Underlying condition predisposing them to bleeding or currently exhibits signs of clinically significant bleeding
Recent history of non-chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenic-associated bleeding =< 1 year prior to the registration
Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrands disease) or hemophilia
History within 3 months prior to treatment of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding/hemorrhage, treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, infectious or inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pulmonary embolus, or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event
No clinically significant bleeding (i.e. gastrointestinal [GI] bleed, intracranial bleeding) within 6 months or major surgery within 4 weeks; minor surgeries (i.e. port placement, cataract surgery) are allowed within 2 weeks
Participants with a recent history (< 6 months) of a major bleed which will be defined as a symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level 2 grams/dL or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or packed red cells
Bleeding and thrombosis:* Patients with evidence of active bleeding: intratumoral hemorrhage by current imaging, or bleeding diathesis are not eligible* Patients with known or prior history in prior 3 months of esophageal varices are not eligible* Patients with a history of CNS arterial/venous thromboembolic events including transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months prior to study enrollment are not eligible* Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism) within 3 months prior to study enrollment are not eligible* Patients with a history of hemoptysis or other signs of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months prior to study enrollment are not eligible* Patients with a history of >= grade 3 bleeding disorders, vasculitis, or had a significant (>= grade 3) episode from the gastrointestinal bleeding, within 6 months prior to enrollment are not eligible* For part B: patients with CNS tumors and evidence of new CNS hemorrhage of more than punctate size and/or more than three foci of punctate hemorrhage on baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained within 14 days prior to study enrollment are not eligible; Note: echocardiogram (ECHO) gradient MRI sequences per institutional guidelines are required for patients with CNS tumors
History of hemoptysis or any significant bleeding within the last 1 month prior to enrollment
Patients with an underlying condition predisposing them to bleeding or currently exhibiting signs of clinically significant bleeding
Patients with a recent history of non-chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenic-associated bleeding within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug
No central lung metastases with excessive active bleeding
Patients must not have had any clinically-significant GI bleeding within 6 months prior to registration and patients must not have a GI disorder which (at the discretion of the investigator) bears a high risk of perforation or fistula; examples of this include (but are not limited to) Crohns disease or tumor with transmural extension through the gastrointestinal lining
Patients with a prior history of gastric/duodenal ulcers documented on endoscopy can be enrolled as long as the ulcers did not cause bleeding requiring a blood transfusion/major intervention; for patients who are Helicobacter pylori positive, a course of Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment must have been completed
No history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) bleeding requiring a blood transfusion, endoscopic or operative intervention
Patients with active bleeding are not eligible; specifically, no clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, GI perforation, intra-abdominal abscess or fistula for 6 months prior to enrollment, no hemoptysis or other signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for 3 months prior to enrollment; patients with evidence of an acute intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage on CT or MRI are not eligible (patients with evidence of resolving hemorrhage will be eligible); in patients with CNS tumors, an MRI with ECHO gradient sequences would be required to exclude presence of petechial hemorrhages
Patients with history of intra-abdominal bleeding or retroperitoneal bleeding within the last 3 years are excluded
