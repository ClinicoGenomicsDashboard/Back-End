The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms within 28 days before enrollment; note: if initial QTcF is found to be > 500 ms, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =< 500 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard
The participant has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms within 28 days before randomization; note: if initial QTcF is found to be > 500 ms, two additional electrocardiogram (ECGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =< 500 ms, the participant meets eligibility in this regard
The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms =< 7 days before the first dose of study treatment
Patients must not have a screening corrected QT using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval > 500 milliseconds (by Fridericia calculation) based on the average of triplicate electrocardiogram (EKG) performed within 7 days prior to registration; note that triplicate EKG is required at other time points
Normal ejection fraction (echocardiogram [ECHO] or cardiac MRI) >= 53% (or the institutional normal; if a range is given then the upper value of the range will be used); corrected QT (QTC) or Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) =< 450 msec
Corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval of > 450 msec at study entry; congenital long QT syndrome
Patients must have QTcF (by Fridericia calculation) < 480/msec based on electrocardiogram (EKG) performed within 28 days prior to registration
QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) > 450 msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG)
The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms within 28 days before treatment; note: if initial QTcF is found to be > 500 ms, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =< 500 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard
Cardiovascular disorders including:* Congestive heart failure (CHF): New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III (moderate) or class IV (severe) at the time of screening* Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) > 140 mm Hg systolic, or > 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment* The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) > 500 ms within 28 days before randomization; Note: if initial QTcF is found to be > 500 ms, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =< 500 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard* Any history of congenital long QT syndrome* Any of the following within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment:** Unstable angina pectoris** Clinically-significant cardiac arrhythmias** Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA], or other ischemic event)** Myocardial infarction** Cardiomyopathy
