Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN except subjects with normal direct bilirubin or those with known Gilberts syndrome, obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization
Serum total bilirubin =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) or direct bilirubin =< ULN for patients with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); for subjects with known Gilberts disease or similar syndrome with slow conjugation of bilirubin, total bilirubin =< 3.0 mg/dL
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN except subjects with normal direct bilirubin or those with known Gilberts syndrome
Total bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN
Within 6 weeks prior to randomization: Total bilirubin must be =< upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory (lab) unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation > ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilberts disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) in absence of Gilbert disease (total bilirubin =< 3 x ULN with Gilbert); also, if hyperbilirubinemia is clearly attributed to liver metastases total bilirubin =< 3 x ULN is permitted
Re-registration: total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN in absence of Gilbert disease (total bilirubin =< 3 x ULN with Gilbert); if hyperbilirubinemia is clearly attributed to liver metastases, total bilirubin =< 3 x ULN is permitted
PARTICIPANTS NOT ON THE HODGKIN LYMPHOMA EXPANSION COHORT: Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) =< 3 x ULN for subjects with Gilberts disease or with atazanavir- or indinavir-induced unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation and must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL, within 2 weeks prior to enrollment
PARTICIPANTS ON THE HODGKIN LYMPHOMA EXPANSION COHORT: Total bilirubin: =<1.5  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), or =< 3 x ULN for participants with Gilberts disease or with atazanavir- or indinavir-induced unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without AST or ALT elevation, and must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL), within 2 weeks prior to enrollment
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x the institutional ULN
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN (patients with Gilberts syndrome may have serum bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN unless Gilberts syndrome of disease infiltration of the liver is present
If no known liver metastases: total bilirubin < 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); if known liver metastases, then: total bilirubin < 2.5 x ULN
Total serum bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN (in patients with known Gilbert syndrome, a total bilirubin =< 3.0 x ULN, with direct bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN)
Total bilirubin must be =< ULN (upper limit of normal) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation > ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilberts disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin within 28 days before randomization
Bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN (=< 3 x ULN for patients with Gilbert syndrome)
