Patients with any significant medical illnesses that, in the investigator's opinion, cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, would compromise a patient's ability to tolerate this therapy or result in inability to assess toxicity; this includes, but is not limited to uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection, cardiac disease, renal impairment or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
A medical or psychiatric illness that precludes ability to give informed consent or is likely to interfere with the ability to comply with the protocol stipulations
Patients must not have any psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol
Patients must have no significant medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude study completion; tests and exams for this determination should be completed within 28 days prior to registration
Serious intercurrent medical illness
Medical or psychiatric illness that would, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude participation in the study or the ability of patients to provide informed consent for themselves
Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or medical (e.g. infectious) illness
Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with study participation
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with study participation
Cognitive impairment, history of medical or psychiatric disease, other uncontrolled intercurrent illness, active substance abuse, or social circumstances, which in the view of the principal investigator (PI), would preclude safe treatment or the ability to give informed consent
Medical or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
Patient must not have intercurrent organ damage or medical problems that will jeopardize the outcome of therapy (i.e., psychiatric disorder, drug abuse, pregnancy)
Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical disorder (aside from malignancy exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subjects safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures
Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study
Patients must NOT suffer from medical or psychiatric conditions that would interfere with protocol compliance, the ability to provide informed consent, or assessment of response or anticipated toxicities; this includes uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection
Subjects with any coexisting medical or psychiatric condition that is likely to interfere with study procedures and/or results
Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial
Any serious or unstable pre-existing medical conditions (aside from malignancy exceptions specified above), psychiatric disorders, or other conditions that could interfere with the subjects safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with study procedures
Patients must not have any serious or unstable pre-existing medical conditions (aside from malignancy exceptions specified above), including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics on day 1, history of bleeding diathesis or need for concurrent anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] =< 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time [PTT] within 1.1 x ULN), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, interfere with subjects safety, or obtaining informed consent
Physical or psychiatric illness/social situations that in the estimation of the investigator would limit compliance with study requirements or place the participant at high risk of toxicity or non-compliance
Other uncontrolled, concurrent illness that would preclude study participation; or, psychiatric illness or social challenges that would entail unreasonable risk or preclude informed consent or compliance with study procedures
Patients with psychiatric, addictive, or any disorder that would prevent compliance with protocol requirements
Medical or psychiatric illness or social situations that would, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude participation in the study or the ability of patients to provide informed consent for themselves
Patient must not have an intercurrent illness likely to interfere with protocol therapy
No history of psychiatric disorders that would preclude participation in the study intervention (e.g. untreated major depression or psychosis, substance abuse, severe personality disorder) or prevent the patient from giving informed consent
Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical disorder (aside from malignancy exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with subjects safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures
