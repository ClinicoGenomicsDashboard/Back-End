Prior surgery for the IHC; (liver resection is not allowed)
A diagnostic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (no other scan type allowed) of the brain must be performed postoperatively; the residual enhancing tumor and/or resection cavity must have a maximal diameter of 5 cm or less; the tumor diameter will be the greatest diameter as measured on the contrast-enhanced postoperative MRI and will include residual disease and/or the postoperative surgical cavity as appropriate* The postoperative brain MRI should be obtained within 72 hours of resection; if it is not obtained within 72 hours post-resection, then an MRI obtained 2 weeks or longer after surgery is required and can be utilized to ensure maximal diameter of residual tumor and/or resection cavity is 5 cm or less* For cases where a gross total resection of enhancing tumor is performed, but postoperative surgical cavity is NOT identifiable, the patient will be excluded from the trial
