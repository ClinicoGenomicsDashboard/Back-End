For Part I: patients with known contraindications to platinum agents are excluded
Known standard therapy for the patients disease that is potentially curative or definitely capable of extending life expectancy; note: patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube will be allowed, if the investigator believes the study treatment is a better alternative to initiation platinum-based chemotherapy, such as patients with a prior platinum allergy or low volume disease for whom platinum-based therapy is deferred until a later date
Patients must be platinum-resistant (platinum-free interval < 6 months) or have platinum-refractory disease as per Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup Committee (GCIC) criteria; disease progression has to be radiologic or clinical; biomarker progression with CA125 after a platinum based regimen would not be sufficient evidence of disease progression; the patients must have had radiological progression to that regimen
Patients must either be eligible to be screened at progression on prior treatment or to be pre-screened prior to progression on current treatment; patients will either consent to the screening consent or the pre-screening consent, not both; these criteria are:* Screening at progression on prior treatment: to be eligible for screening at progression, patients must have received at least one line of systemic therapy for any stage of disease (stages I-IV) and must have progressed during or following their most recent line of therapy; for patients whose prior systemic therapy was for stage I-III disease only (i.e. patient has not received any treatment for stage IV or recurrent disease), the prior systemic therapy must have been a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and disease progression on the platinum-based chemotherapy must have occurred within one year from the last date that patient received that therapy; for patients whose prior therapy was for stage IV or recurrent disease, the patient must have received at least one line of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or checkpoint inhibitor therapy (e.g. nivolumab or pembrolizumab)* Pre-screening prior to progression on current treatment: to be eligible for pre-screening, current treatment must be for stage IV or recurrent disease and patient must have received at least one dose of the current regimen; patients must have previously received or currently be receiving a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or checkpoint inhibitor therapy (e.g. nivolumab or pembrolizumab); patients on first-line platinum-based treatment are eligible upon receiving cycle 1, day 1 infusion; Note: patients will not receive their sub-study assignment until they progress and the S1400 Notice of Progression is submitted
Ovarian cancer patients must be resistant to platinum therapy; therapy (i.e. within 6 months of last platinum therapy); patients who received greater than two prior platinum containing regimens will not be eligible
Platinum-free interval (PFI) - patients must have progressed < 12 months after completion of their last platinum-based chemotherapy; the date (platinum free interval) should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum therapy to documentation of progression
Patient must have developed disease progression during or following treatment with at least one platinum-containing regimen (e.g., gemcitabine/cisplatin [GC], methotrexate-vinblastine-doxorubicin-cisplatin [MVAC], carboplatin, gemcitabine [CarboGem]) for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or disease recurrence, or must be unfit or ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy; there is no restriction on the number of prior lines of chemotherapeutics agents received* Patients who progressed within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen are considered second-line patients; therefore, these patients may be also eligible* Patients who are unfit or ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy as defined by any one of the following criteria are eligible for this trial: ** Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 2** Creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min ** A hearing loss (measured by audiometry) of 25 dB at two contiguous frequencies ** Grade >= 2 peripheral neuropathy
Patients must have platinum-sensitive recurrent high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers; patients with other (clear cell, mixed epithelial, undifferentiated carcinoma, or transitional cell carcinoma) high-risk histologies are also eligible, provided that the patient has a known deleterious germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation identified through testing at a clinical laboratory; Note: Due to the long acceptance of germline BRCA testing through Myriad, Myriad testing will be accepted; if testing for germline BRCA is done by other organizations, documentation from a qualified medical professional (e.g., ovarian cancer specialty physician involved in the field, high risk genetics physician, genetics counselor) listing the mutation and confirming that the laboratory results showed a recognized germline deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or BRCA rearrangement is required; please collect a copy of Myriad or other BRCA mutational analysis (positive or VUS or negative) reports* Platinum-sensitive disease defined as no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease recurrence for > 6 months (or 182 days) after last receipt of platinum-based therapy* Patients must have had a complete clinical response to their prior line of platinum therapy and cannot have had progression through prior platinum-based therapy
Prior therapy:* Prior chemotherapy must have included a first-line platinum-based regimen with or without intravenous consolidation chemotherapy* Patients may have received an unlimited number of platinum-based therapies in the recurrent setting* Patients may have received up to 1 non-platinum-based line of therapy in the recurrent setting; prior hormonal therapy will not be considered to count as this non-platinum-based line* Patients may not have had a prior anti-angiogenic agent in the recurrent setting; prior use of bevacizumab in the upfront or upfront maintenance setting is allowed* Patients may not have previously received a poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor* Prior hormonal-based therapy for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer is acceptable
Patients should have recurrent platinum-resistant or- refractory disease - defined as disease that has progressed by imaging while receiving platinum or had recurrence within 6 months of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy; rising CA125 only is not considered as platinum-resistant or refractory disease
No more than 3 prior treatment regimens (including primary therapy; no more than 1 prior non-platinum based therapy in the platinum-resistant/-refractory setting); hormonal therapies used as single agents (i.e. tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) will not count towards this line limit
Must have received at least one line of standard systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease setting of the respective tumor type; for NSCLC, it is either PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, or platinum-containing chemotherapy, or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or an ALK inhibitor if sensitizing mutation present; TNBC: platinum-containing chemotherapy; PDAC: fluorouracil (5-FU-), gemcitabine-, or taxane-containing chemotherapy either with or without radiation therapy; SCLC: platinum-containing chemotherapy for limited or extensive stage disease
At least 12 months have elapsed since platinum-based peri-operative treatment
Patients must have histologically confirmed high grade serous ovarian or primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer; platinum resistant disease is defined as progression within 6 months after last platinum regimen
Prior therapy: No line limit but no more than 1 prior regimens in the platinum resistant setting; no prior treatment targeting the ATR/checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) pathway and no prior gemcitabine as single agent; hormonal therapies immunotherapy, and antiangiogenic therapies (as single agents) do not count as lines; poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerases (PARP)-inhibitors count as a line of therapy unless given in the maintenance setting; PARP-inhibitors given as maintenance after platinum therapy do not count as a line of therapy; prior carboplatin/gemcitabine is allowed provided that there was no disease progression within 12 months after completion of the carboplatin/gemcitabine regimen; subjects may begin protocol treatment at least 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, after their last dose of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, assuming they are otherwise eligible
Patients with primary platinum refractory disease, defined as progression while first line platinum based chemotherapy
Patients must be in their first platinum sensitive recurrence; this is defined as recurrence that occurred greater than six months after completion of first line platinum based therapy; for the phase 1 portion of the study, patients must have a platinum free interval between 6 months and 1 year and are not eligible or unwilling to undergo a second cytoreductive surgery
Patients who have had prior platinum-based therapy who have > grade 1 neurotoxicity or ototoxicity at the time of enrollment will not be permitted on study
Patients must have received first-line/induction systemic therapy comprising of immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy (a total of 4 cycles or courses), and achieved stable disease or a partial response.
Recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer (defined as progression within < 6 months from completion of platinum based therapy; the date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum therapy)
Patients with prior treatment with bevacizumab (or any other anti vascular therapy, e.g., cediranib) for platinum resistant recurrence; (Note: prior bevacizumab in initial therapy and/or platinum sensitive recurrent setting is allowed)
For the dose expansion cohort, participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of either:* Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer of high grade serous histology which has recurred despite standard therapy; up to 3 prior lines in the platinum resistant setting (i.e. up to 3 lines after patients have become platinum resistant); patients may have received unlimited lines while platinum sensitive* Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) which has recurred despite standard therapy; recurrent TNBC needs to have metastatic disease and patients with an in breast recurrence are not eligible; up to 4 prior lines in the recurrent setting for patients with triple-negative breast cancer are allowed
For the dose expansion cohort, patients with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer must have platinum resistant disease defined as progression within 6 months after last platinum regimen; platinum refractory disease is allowed
Patients must have progressed during or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy; patients whose only prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen was for stage I-III disease (i.e. patient has not received any platinum-based chemotherapy for stage IV or recurrent disease), disease progression on platinum-based chemotherapy must have occurred within one year from the last date that patient received that therapy; patients must have experienced disease progression during or after prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody monotherapy as their most recent line of treatment; prior PD-1/PD-L1 combination therapy is not permitted
Women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma with platinum-resistant disease (defined as having relapsed within 6 months of last platinum-containing regimen because we would like to include both primary and secondary resistance); patients are allowed to have had more than 2 prior cytotoxic treatment regimens; all patients should have received standard of care agents, which confer clinical benefit
