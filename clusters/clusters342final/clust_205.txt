Serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL within 14 days prior to study entry
If the patient is to be treated with cisplatin, the serum creatinine should be =< 1.5 mg%
Serum creatinine =< 2 mg/dL
Creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL
Serum creatinine of =< 1.5 mg/dL; if creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL, creatinine clearance must be >= 60 mL/minute
Serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl
Serum creatinine < 2 mg/dl; NOTE: the above stipulation for normal hepatic function does not apply if liver dysfunction is due to leukemia infiltration
Obtained =< 48 hours prior to registration: Serum creatinine =< 2.0 mg/dl
Creatinine less than 1.4 mg/dl
Creatinine =< 2.0 mg/dL
Creatinine =< 2.0 mg/dL
Patients must have serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dl within 14 days prior to registration
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dl within 14 days prior to registration
Registration Step 3  Maintenance: Patients must have serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dl within 14 days prior to registration
Patients with serum creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL and patients on active dialysis for renal dysfunction are excluded
Creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dl OR creatinine clearance >= 55 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for patients with creatinine levels above 1.5 mg/dl
Serum creatinine =< 3 mg/dL (265 umol/L) and creatinine clearance >= 30 ml/min
Within 14 days of registration: Serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL (176.8 umol/liter)
Within 14 days of registration: Serum calcium =< 11.5 mg/dL
Creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL to receive weekly cisplatin* Patients whose serum creatinine is between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL are eligible for cisplatin if the estimated creatinine clearance (CCr) is >= 30 ml/min; for the purpose of estimating the CCr, the formula of Cockcroft and Gault for females should be used
Creatinine =< 2.0 mg/dL
Creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl (= 132 umol/L) or
Creatinine < 1.7 mg/dL
Within 14 days prior to registration: Serum creatinine =< 2.0 mg/dL
Creatinine < 2 mg/dl
Creatinine =< 1.6 mg/dl
Serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl
