The participant has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) =< grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except =< grade 2 alopecia, neuropathy, and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs)
Toxicities of prior therapy (excepting alopecia) should be resolved to less than or equal to grade 1 as per National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE); patients with long-standing stable grade 2 neuropathy may be considered after discussion with the overall principal investigator (PI), but may not receive carboplatin and paclitaxel as the reference regimen, if randomized to that arm
Toxicities of prior therapy (excepting alopecia) should be resolved to less than or equal to grade 1 as per CTCAE v 4.0
Patients in whom prior treatment related toxicities have not recovered to grade 1 or less (except for alopecia)
Toxicities of prior therapy (except alopecia) should be resolved to =< grade 1 as per National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0; patients with long-standing stable grade 2 neuropathy may be considered after discussion with the study principal investigator (PI)
Available for follow-up of their disease after treatment until progressive disease is documented and resolution of related adverse events until < grade 2
Resolution of any adverse events (AEs) from prior treatments must be resolved to baseline or grade =< 1 at enrollment (with the exception of alopecia), neuropathy, and ototoxicity (i.e., AEs that are not expected to improve within the washout period)
