Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
Patients must not have an active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
Known hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (patients with chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection are eligible); patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible if on anti-retroviral medications
A history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of cleared HBV and HCV infection, which will be allowed)
A history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of cleared HBV and HCV infection, which will be allowed)
Known history of hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (patients with chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection are eligible); it is not necessary to conduct HBV and HCV testing at screening
Active hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (patients with chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection are eligible)
Known hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (patients with chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection are eligible); patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible if on anti-retroviral medications
No known active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV); patients with chronic or cleared HBV infection and HCV infection are eligible
Known hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (patients with chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection are eligible); patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible if on anti-retroviral medications
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection, which will be allowed); patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible if on anti-retroviral medications
Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection are not eligible; patients with cleared HBV and HCV infection will be allowed
A history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of cleared HBV and HCV infection, which will be allowed)
Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are not eligible; patients with cleared HBV and HCV (0 viral load) infection will be allowed
Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are eligible provided they meet the other eligibility criteria and:* There is no evidence of hepatic damage related to HBV infection* They have had consistently suppressed HBV viral load to undetectable levels by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a minimum of 12 months
Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are eligible provided they meet the other eligibility criteria and:* They have previously undergone curative therapy and have no evidence of active HCV infection* They have no evidence of liver damage owing to prior HCV infection
Patients with active HCV infection should be referred for HCV treatment and standard radiotherapy for the plasmacytoma
Uncontrolled hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, defined as plasma HBV DNA detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)* Note: the following will NOT be exclusionary:** A positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb] positive and hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] negative), or a fully resolved acute HBV infection** Patients with chronic HBV suppressed by appropriate antiretroviral therapy with activity against HBV, as outlined in DHHS guidelines
Uncontrolled hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, defined as plasma HCV RNA detectable by PCR* Note: the following will NOT be exclusionary:** Positive HCV serology but no detectable HCV RNA, indicative of spontaneously cleared HCV infection** Patients who have been successfully treated for HCV as long as therapy for HCV has been completed
Patients with known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections
No known chronic active liver disease or evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV)
Patients must not have known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis virus (HCV) infection at time of registration; patients with HBV or HCV that have an undetectable viral load, or in the opinion of the treating investigator is well-controlled, are eligible
Patients with a known history of hepatitis C (HCV) will be eligible if they have an undetectable viral load; if the patient received treatment for HCV, then that treatment must have been completed at least three weeks prior to enrollment
Patients with known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection should be excluded; however, if a patient has HBV history with an undetectable HBV load by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), no liver-related complications, and is on definitive HBV therapy, then he/she would be eligible for study
Patients with known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; patients with a history of HCV infection who received definitive therapy and has an undetectable viral load by PCR would be eligible
Patients must not have known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prior to registration; patients who have completed curative therapy for HCV are eligible; patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are eligible if they meet each of the following 3 criteria:* CD4 counts >= 350 mm^3* Serum HIV viral load of < 25,000 IU/ml and* Treated on a stable antiretroviral regimen
Patients must not have known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prior to registration
Known hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (patients with chronic or cleared HBV and HCV infection are eligible)
