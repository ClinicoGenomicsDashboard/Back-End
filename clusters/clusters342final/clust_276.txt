Patients must have had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery; the recommended neoadjuvant treatment should include 16-24 weeks of a third generation chemotherapy regimen as recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for triple negative breast cancer (examples include dose dense adriamycin-cytoxan [AC] followed by dose-dense paclitaxel; weekly paclitaxel x 12 followed or preceded by cyclophosphamide-adriamycin-fluorouracil [FAC], fluorouracil-epirubicin-cytoxan [FEC], AC or dose dense AC; docetaxel either followed or preceded by FEC/FAC or AC; carboplatin-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also allowed); patients who cannot complete all planned treatment cycles for any reason are considered high risk and therefore are eligible for the study if they have residual disease; patients must have resolution of adverse event(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to grade 1 or less, except alopecia and =< grade 2 neuropathy which are allowed
Patients may receive post-operative (adjuvant) chemotherapy for up to 24 weeks of duration (e.g. 8 cycles of capecitabine as in the CREATE-X trial) after completion of surgery at the discretion of the treating physician; patients must have resolution of adverse event(s) of the most recent prior chemotherapy to grade 1 or less, except alopecia and =< grade 2 neuropathy which are allowed; patients that have received adjuvant chemotherapy must be registered to screening within 35 days after completing treatment
