Uncontrolled infection at the time of enrollment; infections controlled on concurrent anti-microbial agents are acceptable, and anti-microbial prophylaxis per institutional guidelines is acceptable
Active systemic infections requiring intravenous antibiotics
Concurrent opportunistic infections
Active systemic infections (for e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation disorders or other active major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease
