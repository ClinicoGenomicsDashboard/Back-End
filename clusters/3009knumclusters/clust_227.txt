Patients must be previously untreated and must NOT have any of the following indications for chemotherapy:\r\n* Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of or worsening anemia (=< 11 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (=< 100 x 10^9/L) not due to autoimmune disease\r\n* Symptomatic or progressive lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly\r\n* One or more of the following disease-related symptoms:\r\n** Weight loss >= 10% within the previous 6 months\r\n** Extreme fatigue attributed to CLL\r\n** Fevers > 100.4 degree Fahrenheit (o^F) for 2 weeks without evidence of infection\r\n** Drenching night sweats without evidence of infection\r\nNote: 1) Prior chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody based therapy for treatment of CLL or SLL will be considered prior therapy; nutraceutical treatments with no established benefit in CLL (such as epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG, found in green tea or other herbal treatments) will not be considered “prior treatment”\r\n2) Prior corticosteroid therapy for an indication other than CLL/SLL will not be considered “prior treatment”; previous use of corticosteroids for treatment of autoimmune complications of CLL/SLL does not constitute prior therapy for CLL/SLL
