Patients diagnosed with HCC, who will undergo resection or transplantation within 6 months, as part of routine clinical care and patients diagnosed with unresectable HCC
Patients with unresectable HCC undergoing systemic therapy based on clinical indication or approved drug trial; and/or undergoing clinically indicated Y90 radioembolization
HCC PATIENTS: Patient with confirmed diagnosis of HCC, and untreated or
HCC PATIENTS: Patients with suspected HCC (suspected HCC nodules should preferably be smaller than 3 cm and preferably within 6 cm in depth of the transducer head to minimize attenuation) and untreated or
HCC PATIENTS: Patients at a higher risk of HCC undergoing a screening program by ultrasound
Liver tumor diagnosed histologically as HCC or suspected of being HCC in association with serum alpha-fetoprotein level > 200 or tumor mass with characteristics of malignancy on diagnostic imaging
Part 1: HCC; cholangiocarcinoma; or esophageal, nasopharyngeal, or serous ovarian cancer, regardless of FGF/FGFR status.
Cohort A: HCC with FGF19 amplification.
Cohort B: HCC without FGF19 amplification.
Histologically confirmed HCC, not amenable to transplant, resection or loco-regional therapy
Other active malignancy besides HCC within 3 years.
Must be listed for liver transplantation with HCC exception points based on the imaging diagnosis of at least one Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) class 5 HCC lesion(s) per study-defined imaging criteria (participating institutions may not enroll patients in whom the HCC diagnosis is solely based on biopsy and who do not have at least one liver lesion that meets imaging criteria for OPTN Stage 2, Class 5 HCC)\r\n* Patients must meet one of the following descriptions based on imaging findings:\r\n** EITHER OPTN Class 5B: at least 1 focal liver lesion(s) >= 2 cm diameter compatible with imaging diagnosis of Stage II HCC on contrast-enhanced CT imaging and/or contrast-enhanced MRI;\r\n** OR OPTN Class 5A: 2 or 3 focal liver lesions, each between > 1 and < 3 cm diameter, if each is compatible with imaging diagnosis of HCC on contrast-enhanced CT imaging and/or contrast-enhanced MRI\r\n** Imaging findings at the patient level in both situations must be within the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Stage 2, which is Milan criteria
Does not meet OPTN Class 5 imaging criteria for HCC, even if they have biopsy-proven HCC; NOTE: Patients enrolled to the trial under the “Declaration of Intent to List” mechanism who fail to be listed with HCC MELD/PELD Score Exception history data on the UNOS UNET Web site within 60 days from enrollment will come off trial and will not be counted towards target accrual
Subjects must have verified unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diagnosed on the basis of clinical and imaging criteria
Subjects must satisfy one of the following conditions pertaining to their eligibility to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT):\r\n* HCC that is within Milan Criteria, i.e., TACE is indicated as a “bridge” to OLT (Group I); or\r\n* HCC that is outside Milan Criteria, i.e., TACE is indicated as a means of “down-staging” into transplant eligibility (Group II)
Subjects who have received prior treatment for HCC (prior surgical procedures not related to HCC are allowed)
History of HCC or suspicious mass on imaging within 6 months prior to ascertainment of eligibility
HCC screening prior to randomization
