If patients are on immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of graft versus host disease (GVHD), then only those on stable doses for at least 4 weeks (or on tapering doses) will be eligible
If patients are on immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of graft versus host disease (GVHD), then only those on stable doses for at least 4 weeks (or on tapering doses) will be eligible

Any evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal or hepatic acute GVHD, or evidence of greater than ongoing stage I cutaneous acute GVHD; ongoing, tapering therapy for resolved acute GVHD is permissible
Any evidence of prior active or resolved chronic GVHD
Any evidence of cGVHD or late acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) between enrollment and first dose of obinutuzumab
Planned graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus (TAC)/methotrexate (MTX) or TAC/sirolimus (SRL)
Active acute or chronic GVHD
No signs or symptoms of acute graft versus host disease; however prior acute GVHD which is resolved and controlled with low dose steroids (< 0.3 mg/kg/day for at least 1 week) may be eligible
Any evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal or hepatic acute GVHD or evidence of greater than ongoing stage I cutaneous acute GVHD at time of enrollment; ongoing, tapering therapy for resolved acute GVHD is permissible
Active systemic treatment for graft versus host disease.
HSCT recipients with active and/or chronic graft versus host disease

Presence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
Subject has received a prior HCT and has residual Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease (cGVHD)
Previous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant within 6 months prior to enrollment, active graft versus host disease (GVHD), or requiring transplant-related immunosuppression.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) within 60 days of screening, or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease treatment or prophylaxis within 14 days of first protocol therapy, or active graft-versus-host-disease

Patients who have undergone prior allogeneic transplantation are eligible provided they do not have significant active graft versus host disease and that their transplant day 0 is > 6 months from their first dose of chemotherapy
Acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) Grade III or IV, or severe chronic GvHD.
Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant with active graft-versus-host- disease (GVHD).
Previously received an allogeneic stem cell transplant and the occurrence of one or more of the following: received the transplant within 6 months prior to study day 1;received immunosuppressive therapy within the last 3 months prior to study day 1;having signs or symptoms of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, no evidence of active graft-versus host disease (GVHD) and must be ? 2 weeks off immunosuppressive therapy.
The patient underwent autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant within 60 days prior to receiving the first dose of omacetaxine and has any evidence of ongoing graft versus host disease (GVHD), or GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy.
Prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with active graft versus host disease (GVHD) on therapeutic dosing of immunosuppression or prednisone > 20 mg daily equivalent
Patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) will be eligible if they are more than 90 days removed from the date of stem cell infusion, have no evidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or active chronic (grade 2-4) GVHD, and are off of all transplant-related immunosuppression for at least 2 weeks
Subjects on systemic immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at the time of screening, or with clinically significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The use of topical steroids for ongoing skin or ocular GVHD is permitted.
Has undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within the last 5 years. Note: Participants who have had a transplant greater than 5 years ago are eligible as long as there are no symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
