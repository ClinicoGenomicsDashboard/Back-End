A condom is required to be used also by vasectomised males in order to\n             prevent potential delivery of the study drug via seminal fluid.

Periodic abstinence (e.g.,\n                  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are\n                  not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\n               -  Female sterilisation: The patient has had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with\n                  or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior to taking study\n                  drug. In case of an oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status of the patient\n                  must have been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.\n\n               -  Male partner sterilisation: The patient has the appropriate post-vasectomy\n                  documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate.

These patients must also agree to the use an intrauterine device or\n                  intrauterine system AND a barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive\n                  cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, or\n                  cream, or vaginal suppository. Reliable contraception must be maintained\n                  throughout the study and for 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation.\n\n               -  Females considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential: The\n                  definition applies to females who have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)\n                  amenorrhoea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history\n                  of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with serum\n                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels > 40 million international units per\n                  milliliter (mIU/mL) (for US only: and estradiol < 20 pg/mL) or have had surgical\n                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks prior to\n                  starting treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive\n                  status of the patient has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is\n                  she considered not of childbearing potential.\n\n          3.
