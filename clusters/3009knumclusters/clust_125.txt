Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer
Participants must have biopsy proven invasive breast carcinoma stages T1cN0 to T3N0, estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) positive with tumors greater than 1 cm without lymph node spread
Histologically confirmed TNBC (i.e., estrogen receptor [ER] negative, progesterone receptor [PR] negative (each < 10% staining by immunohistochemistry) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) negative (0-1+ or fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] nonamplified; by clinical assay on primary tumor)
Patients must have estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) non-expressing breast cancer defined as:\r\n* < 1% of tumor nuclei that are immunoreactive for ER and PR\r\n* Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio of less than 2.0 or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of 0 or 1+
Tumors must be estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive according to ASCO/CAP 2010 guidelines as either ER or PR ? 1% positive nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry based on local laboratory results.
Tumors must be HER2 negative as defined according to ASCO/CAP 2013, as HER2 0 - 1+ by IHC or non-amplified FISH or CISH. If HER2 IHC is 2+, FISH/CISH must be performed and must not be positive (HER2/CEP17 ratio must be < 2, and HER2 copy number < 6 signals/cell), but otherwise FISH/CISH is not required if IHC is 0 or 1+ by institutional standards.
Patients must have estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast\n             cancer (MBC) with at least one non-irradiated distant site of metastasis.
Triple-negative disease (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negativity confirmed on a histological biopsy of a metastatic tumor lesion (receptor conversion not allowed).
Histologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer with evidence of metastatic disease or locoregional recurrence. 3. Histological confirmation and documentation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive status (?1% positive stained cells). 4. Histological or cytological confirmation and documentation of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative status by local laboratory testing using criteria in the American Society of Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) Clinical Practice Guideline update.
