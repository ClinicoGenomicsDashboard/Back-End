Breast imaging should include imaging of the ipsilateral axilla; for subjects with a clinically negative axilla, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed either up front or after preoperative therapy at the discretion of the subject’s physicians; for subjects with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure will be performed prior to registration to confirm the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes; while not mandated by the protocol, it is strongly recommended that participants with positive lymph nodes undergo a level I and II lymph node dissection at the time of definitive surgery; participants with axillary adenopathy only are not eligible for this study
