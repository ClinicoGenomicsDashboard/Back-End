Uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive\n             pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the Investigator\n             would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications during the\n             study.\n\n         12. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled\n             infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric illness/social\n             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n         13.
