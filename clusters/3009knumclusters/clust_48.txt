Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. The effects of atezolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown and radiotherapy has known teratogenic effects so women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and 4 months after completion of atezolizumab administration
The effects of MCS110, trametinib and dabrafenib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 months after the last dose of MCS110. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of MCS110 administration. Highly Effective contraception methods include:\r\n* Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\r\n* Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\r\n* Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject\r\n* Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate < 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment\r\n* Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/cream/suppository)
Female subjects who are pre-menopausal or have experienced menopause for less than 2 years and who have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal occlusion must have a negative serum pregnancy test during Screening and a serum or urine pregnancy test must be re-confirmed as negative no more than 72 hours before starting AG-270. Females of reproductive potential as well as fertile men with partners who are female of reproductive potential must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use 2 effective forms of contraception from the time of giving informed consent, during the study, and for 3 months (females and males) following the last dose of AG-270. Effective forms of contraception are defined as hormonal oral contraceptives, injectables, patches, intrauterine devices, double-barrier methods (eg, synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), or male partner sterilization.
Participants of childbearing potential (as defined above) must be willing to use effective contraception during treatment and up to 7 months after stop of trial treatment. Acceptable methods of contraception are intrauterine devices, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized, or total abstinence. Oral, injectable, or implant hormonal contraceptives are not allowed.
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include: bilateral tubal ligation; male partner sterilization; hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation; hormone-releasing intrauterine devices; copper intrauterine devices.
Female subjects must be surgically sterile, or have a monogamous partner who is surgically sterile, or at least 2 years postmenopausal, or who commits to use an acceptable form of birth control (defined as the use of an intrauterine device, a barrier method with spermicide, condoms, any form of hormonal contraceptives, or abstinence) for the duration of the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study treatment.

For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use of contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the last study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (>= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception
Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the final dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab; cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician; they must also refrain\r\nfrom egg cell donation for 180 days after the final dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab\r\n* Note: A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly; the acceptable methods of contraception include barrier methods (male condom plus spermicide, copper T intrauterine device, levonorgesterel-releasing intrauterine system) or hormonal methods (implants, hormone shot or injection, combined pill, minipill, patch)
Females of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the time of informed consent until 6 months after treatment discontinuation; the two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method or an intrauterine device that meets < 1% failure rate for protection from pregnancy in the product label
Patient of childbearing potential is using either 2 adequate barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method of contraception to prevent pregnancy or to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study, starting with visit 1 through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy; approved contraceptive methods include 2 of the following barrier methods or one barrier method combined with a hormonal contraceptive: a. intra uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male condoms, or female condom with spermicide; spermicides or condoms alone are not an acceptable method of contraception; b. male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy
Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically sterile) must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device) during the study, and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation
Male and female subjects who agree to use highly effective methods of birth control (e.g., condoms, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices [IUDs], sexual abstinence, or sterilized partner) during the period of therapy and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug
Individuals of reproductive potential and their partners willing to practice total abstinence or use a highly effective method of contraception (failure rate < 1% per year) during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of rucaparib; the following are allowable only:\r\n* Ongoing use of progesterone-only injectable or implantable contraceptives (eg, Depo Provera, Implanon, Nexplanon)\r\n* Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system\r\n* Bilateral tubal occlusion\r\n* Sterilization, with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of absence of sperm in ejaculate\r\n* True, complete (as opposed to periodic) abstinence
Women of childbearing potential must commit to either abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously. This includes one highly effective form of contraception (tubal ligation, intrauterine device, hormonal [birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants] or partner’s vasectomy) and one additional effective contraceptive method (male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap). Contraception must begin prior to dosing. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must always use a latex or synthetic condom during the study and for 4 months after discontinuing daratumumab
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women of child-bearing potential who are not willing to use two highly effective methods of contraception (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence)
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized; suggested precautions should be used to minimize the risk or pregnancy for at least 1 month before start of therapy, and while women are on study for at least 8 weeks after pembrolizumab is stopped; WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal; acceptable forms of birth control include condom, diaphragm, hormonal, intrauterine device (IUD), or sponge plus spermicide; abstinence is also an acceptable form of birth control
Female participants of childbearing potential should ensure use of a highly effective method of birth control as defined by the investigator, for example, those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectable, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner during the study and for a period of at least 4 months following the last dose of any drug administered during the study

Sexually active females of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine device [IUD], surgical sterilization, subcutaneous implants, or abstinence, etc.) for the duration of the vaccination period; sexually active males must agree to use barrier contraceptive for the duration of the vaccination period
Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective methods of contraception during the study and 8 weeks after; highly effective contraception methods include combination of any two of the following:\r\n* Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, or\r\n* Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)\r\n* Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository\r\n* Total abstinence \r\n* Male/female sterilization\r\n* Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential
Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 72 hours before the start of the investigational product; in addition, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for a minimum of 4 month following last plerixafor dose and 6 months following last bevacizumab dose \r\n* Effective birth control includes:\r\n** Birth control pills, depot progesterone, or an intrauterine device plus one barrier method\r\n** Or 2 barrier methods\r\n* Effective barrier methods are male and female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm)\r\n* Hormonal contraceptive methods are not sufficient, as information about any interaction of plerixafor with hormonal contraceptives is not known\r\n* Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately
Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. A urine pregnancy test should be repeated prior to chemotherapy if not conducted within 72 hours of start of treatment. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or have a vasectomized partner) having started for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. Male subjects who are not abstinent or who have undergone a successful vasectomy, who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use, a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Subjects with partners using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously).
Adults of reproductive potential must be able and agree to use appropriate contraception; double barrier contraceptives must be used throughout the trial by both sexes\r\n* Women of childbearing potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who have had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test =< 72 hours prior to initiating treatment\r\n* Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels > 40 mIU/mL (and estradiol < 20 pg/mL) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential\r\n* Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study; women assigned to ARMS AC and D must use highly effective contraception for 16 weeks after stopping treatment; women assigned to ARM A must continue contraceptive measures for 4 weeks after stopping treatment; women assigned to ARM B must continue contraceptive measures for 5 weeks after stopping treatment; the highly effective contraception is defined as either:\r\n** True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\r\n** Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment\r\n** Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); for female subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient\r\n** Use of a combination of any two of the following:\r\n*** Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)\r\n*** Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel /film/cream/vaginal suppository
For ARMs A, C and D, oral contraception (OC), injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 and potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives; for ARM B, oral contraceptives, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as the sole method of contraception, as BYL719 has not been characterized with respect to its potential to interfere with the PK and/or the effectiveness of OCs
Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last vaccination has been administered

Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must be strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of non-hormonal contraception; acceptable contraception includes barrier methods (e.g., condoms or diaphragm) or intrauterine devices or IUDs (these may include low-dose hormones at the discretion of the Study Chair)
Female patients of reproductive potential, defined as not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post-menopausal (see above for definition) and non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of reproductive potential must be willing to adhere to the following restrictions:\r\n* Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from the time of screening until 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy; cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician; periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control; it is strongly recommended that non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period; not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice\r\n* Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy; periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control; not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period; it is strongly recommended that female partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients to also use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period\r\n* Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly\r\n** Barrier/intrauterine methods\r\n*** Copper T intrauterine device\r\n*** Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system (e.g., Mirena); this is also considered a hormonal method\r\n** Hormonal methods\r\n*** Implants: etonogestrel-releasing implants: e.g. Implanon or Norplant\r\n*** Intravaginal: ethinylestradiol/etonogestrel releasing intravaginal devices: e.g. NuvaRing\r\n*** Injection: medroxyprogesterone injection: e.g. Depo-Provera\r\n*** Combined pill: normal and low dose combined oral contraceptive pill\r\n*** Patch: norelgestromin/ethinylestradiol releasing transdermal system: e.g. Ortho Evra\r\n*** Minipill: progesterone based oral contraceptive pill using desogestrel: Cerazette is currently the only highly effective progesterone based pill
Women of childbearing age, women who are made postmenopausal through use of GNRH agonists, and men must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of protocol treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose of palbociclib if the risk of contraception exists; adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective non-hormonal form of contraception or two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception by the participant and/or partner\r\n* Highly effective non-hormonal contraception\r\n** Methods of birth control which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are considered highly-effective forms of contraception\r\n** The following non-hormonal methods of contraception are acceptable:\r\n*** True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception)\r\n*** Male sterilization (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); for female participants, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner OR\r\n* Effective non-hormonal contraception\r\n** Alternatively two of the following effective forms of contraception may be used instead:\r\n*** Placement of non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); consideration should be given to the type of device being used, as there is higher failure rates quoted for certain types, e.g., steel or copper wire\r\n*** Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository\r\n*** Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository\r\n*** The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of spermicide; the following should be noted:\r\n**** Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly effective forms of contraception; therefore, the use of additional spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection\r\n**** However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spilled; therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone\r\n* It should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required; a double barrier method is acceptable, which is defined as condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository

A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Acceptable methods of contraception are described in Table 4.2.1-1. Sustained abstinence is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception
Male subjects with partners of child-bearing potential, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to abstain from sexual activity or to use 2 medically approved contraceptive measures / regimens from the time of signing the informed consent form through 3 months after the treatment period\r\n* Effective birth control includes: (a) birth control pills, depot progesterone, or an intrauterine device plus one barrier method; or (b) 2 barrier methods; effective barrier methods are male and female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); for subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method, information about any interaction of plerixafor with hormonal contraceptives is not known
Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (ie: a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of the study.
Women of childbearing potential must be practicing a highly effective method of birth control consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for participants participating in clinical studies: example, established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); barrier methods: condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; male partner sterilization (the vasectomized partner should be the sole partner for that participant); true abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant) during and after the study (3 months after the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen)
A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had a vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control example, either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men must also not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of any component of the treatment regimen. The exception to this restriction is that if the participant's female partner is surgically sterile, a second method of birth control is not required
Women who are pregnant or lactating are ineligible due to teratogenic effects on developing fetuses; women who are of child-bearing potential need to practice effective methods of contraception including oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicides, and/or abstinence
Subjects (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception beginning at the signing of the ICF until at least 2 months after the last dose of study drug.
