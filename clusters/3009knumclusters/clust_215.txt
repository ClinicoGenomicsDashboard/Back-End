Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 (except lenvatinib for patients in cohort 2) or who has not recovered (i.e., =< grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent\r\n* NOTE: \r\n** Subjects with =< grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study\r\n** If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to registration, as deemed by treating investigator or site PI
Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =< grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent\r\n* Note: subjects with =< grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study\r\n* Note: if subject received major surgery, they must wait >= 3 weeks prior to starting study treatment, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy
Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =< grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent\r\n* Note: subjects with =< grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study\r\n* Note: if subject received major surgery, they must wait >= 3 weeks prior to starting study treatment; they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy
Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1; Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy
Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy including investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ? Grade 1 or at baseline) from AEs due to a previously administered agent.
Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =< grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent; patients who previously received RT in any form would not be eligible\r\n* Note: Subjects with =< grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study\r\n* Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy
If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy
Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to study day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., =< grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent; note: if subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy; note: toxicities that specifically define eligibility for this protocol (nephropathy, otopathy, neuropathy, or other as allowed by principal investigator [PI]) are exceptions
