Pre-imaging laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days prior to the [18F] FLT imaging procedure; these must be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry into the study (unless clinically not relevant); in those instances where a laboratory value is outside of this range, then such a patient will be ineligible for enrollment; for follow-up scanning sessions after therapy has been instituted, laboratory testing will also be required due to the use of [18F] FLT; the patients have brain tumors and will have received chemoradiation; therefore, many routine laboratory tests may not be within the typical normal range; as such, a factor of 4.0 times above or below the upper or lower value for the normal range for any laboratory test will also be used to determine the acceptable range for the 2nd and possibly 3rd imaging time points (unless clinically not relevant); the baseline laboratory testing will include liver enzymes (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), bilirubin (total), serum electrolytes, complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine; for those patients receiving coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range

Pre-treatment laboratory tests for patients receiving [18F]FMISO must be performed within 21 days prior to the FMISO scan; these laboratory tests must be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry into the study (unless not clinically relevant); for those patients receiving Coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range
Pre-treatment laboratory tests for patients receiving [18F]FLT must be performed within 21 days prior to study entry; these must be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry into the study (unless clinically not relevant); in those instances where a baseline laboratory value is outside of this range, then such a patient will be ineligible for enrollment; for the follow-up scanning sessions after therapy has been instituted, laboratory testing will also be required due to the use of FLT; the patients have brain tumors and will have received various forms of therapy; therefore, many routine laboratory tests may not be within the typical normal range; as such, a factor of 4.0 times above or below the upper or lower value for the normal range for any laboratory test will also be used to determine the acceptable range for the 2nd and possible 3rd imaging time points (unless clinically not relevant); the baseline laboratory testing will include liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALK], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]), bilirubin (total), serum electrolytes, complete blood count (CBC) with platelets and, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine; previous urinalysis abnormalities will not preclude the patient from being studied; for those patients receiving Coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range
Note: Exceptions to laboratory (lab) parameters may be allowed with approval of the Protocol Chair

Subject must meet the following criteria as indicated on the clinical laboratory tests:
The patient has hepatic dysfunction confirmed by bilirubin > 2 x normal (based on reference values from the laboratory used by the patient)
For the follow-up scanning sessions after therapy has been instituted and within 7 days prior to the second [18F]FLT study the laboratory assessments will be required due to the use of [18F]FLT; these studies should also be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory study (unless not clinically relevant); 2.5 x for prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time; however at the discretion of the study principal investigator (PI) the second imaging sessions can occur if laboratory values are not within the 4 X upper limit of normal (unless not clinically relevant); for those patients receiving Coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range; for the assessments at subsequent imaging time points the laboratory tests as described for baseline assessment will again be obtained
