Donors must be either:\r\n* HLA-haploidentical or HLA-identical relatives of the patient based on allele or allele group level typing
Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody\r\n* Note: in some instances, low level, non-cytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a level well below that detectable by flow cytometry; this will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the principal investigator (PI) and one of the immunogenetics directors; pheresis to reduce anti-HLA antibodies is permissible; however eligibility to proceed with the transplant regimen would be contingent upon the success of the desensitization
