Lab values that in the opinion of the primary surgeon would prevent surgical resection
Surgical intervention within 28 days prior to the first dose of M3541 administration
Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization or anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for diagnosis; placement of central venous access catheter(s) (e.g., port or similar) is not considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted
Patients must have received prior surgical resection and radiation therapy for the progressive meningioma
An interval of at least 2 weeks (to start of study agent) between prior surgical resection or one week for stereotactic biopsy
Prior major surgical procedure or radiation therapy within specified period of the first dose of study treatment (with defined exception).
Major surgery within 4 weeks of study entry; minor surgical procedures (e.g. port insertion, pleurex catheter placement) are not excluded, but sufficient time should have passed for wound healing
Requiring tissue diagnosis (fine needle aspiration [FNA], core biopsy, surgical biopsy, surgical resection), or clinical follow-ups for at least 6 months
Planned thorascopic, robotic or laparoscopic surgical approach
Surgical or core biopsy scheduled within 4 weeks of MRI/MRE

Is scheduled for surgery and/or another invasive procedure other than the primary surgical intervention within the 3 days after Lymphoseek administration
Subjects with suspected brain tumors undergoing surgical removal as their standard of care will be eligible; these may include subjects status post chemotherapy and/or radiation or subjects who have undergone diagnostic biopsy for their original diagnosis and are felt to be candidates for resection
Lab values that in the opinion of the primary surgeon would prevent surgical resection
Planned for treatment with radiation, chemotherapy and surgical resection or any of these treatment strategies combined
Tumor must be determined to be surgically resectable; surgical resection is planned to take place at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
For patients who have undergone surgical resection prior to joining the study, in whom baseline magnetic resonance (MR) images exhibit enough signal degradation (due to susceptibility artifact in the region of the surgical bed) such that the data are uninterpretable will be excluded
Prior esophageal or gastric surgical resection.
Subjects scheduled for surgical intervention, with a sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure being a part of the surgical plan.
Surgical candidate
Positive surgical margins, or
Patients must have a planned surgical resection of the rectum
Patient must have selected mastectomy for surgical option of treatment
Patient must be eligible for definitive surgical therapy for primary NSCLC
Have a surgical target =< 6 cm from the skin when lying supine
Have a discreet surgical target
Have undergone previous open surgical biopsy, lumpectomy, or mastectomy in the operative breast
Major surgical procedures =< 28 days of beginning study treatment, or minor surgical procedures =< 7 days (minor procedures done at time of laparoscopy are allowed); no waiting required following port-a-cath placement
Participants must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon that is localized, with no evidence of distant metastasis (stage I, II, or III), and for which surgical resection of the primary tumor is being planned; OR participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon with resectable liver metastases for which liver resection is being planned; OR participants may have a colon biopsy that is suspicious for adenocarcinoma if clinical and/or endoscopic findings strongly support the presence of malignancy, and if surgical resection is being planned; NOTE: in the unlikely event that the final pathology of the surgical resection specimen is consistent with high-grade adenoma or dysplasia, the patient will not be considered ineligible and collected research samples will still be utilized
Prior surgical evaluation and plan for surgical biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor being injected.
DYNAMIC COHORT: Clinical plan for biopsy or surgical procedure of at least one site of known or suspected cancer
DYNAMIC COHORT: Willing to consent to collection of pathology tissue for the purposes of research at the time of clinical biopsy or surgical procedure
DYNAMIC COHORT: No clinical plan for biopsy or surgical procedure of known or suspected cancer
Patients must have a previous diagnosis of a recurrent or progressive glioblastoma for which surgical resection is now indicated
Planned surgical resection
Scheduled date of surgical resection that would limit the amount of time taking the intervention to less than 21 days
Patients scheduled for definitive HNC cancer surgical resection less than 10 days from enrollment or greater than five weeks from enrollment

the OSCC treatment plan includes surgical resection
Patient must be able to tolerate a major surgical procedure based on clinical evaluation, status of their cancer, and any other underlying medical problems
A member of the patient’s surgical team must indicate equipoise for the benefit of the surgical treatment for MBO; the surgeon must respond “Yes” to each of the following questions and sign the S1316 Surgical Equipoise Documentation form for the patient to be eligible:\r\n* Is surgery for treatment of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) being considered for this patient?\r\n* Do you have equipoise? if the treating team finds that an operation is required (e.g., for acute abdomen), or they would not offer the patient an operation (e.g., patient is too weak to tolerate surgery), then there is no equipoise
Patients must be registered to the study within 3 working days after being seen by surgical team for MBO or within 3 working days after completion of indicated treatment (e.g. total parenteral nutrition [TPN], anticoagulation reversal) to make them eligible for surgical intervention, whichever is later, and prior to any treatment (surgical or non-surgical) for MBO; treatment is defined as any medication or invasive interventions beyond nasogastric decompression, hydration, pain medications or antiemetic medications; NOTE: somatostatin analogues may be used prior to registration if that use is limited to not more than the two days just prior to registration
