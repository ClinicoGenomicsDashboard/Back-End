Diabetes
Uncontrolled diabetes; subjects with diabetes mellitus are not excluded if the condition is well-controlled (glycated hemoglobin [A1C] < 7.5)

Subjects may have diabetes mellitus
History of diabetes mellitus
Subjects with a history of diabetes;
Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 8% despite adequate therapy; patients with a known history of impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus (DM) may be included, however blood glucose and antidiabetic treatment must be monitored closely throughout the trial and adjusted as necessary
Patients with controlled diabetes are allowed on study; controlled diabetes is defined as < 130 ml/dL for the sake of this study
Patients with known diabetes mellitus which is poorly controlled (defined as hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] > 7%) are ineligible; subjects with a history of transient glucose intolerance due to corticosteroid administration are allowed in this study if all other inclusion/exclusion have been met
