Histologic confirmation is not required for this if the patient has neurofibromatosis type  (NF-) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings consistent with optic pathway glioma or juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA); any other tumors will need histological confirmation, either at the time of diagnosis or at the time of recurrence; the histological diagnosis includes World Health Organization (WHO) grade I JPA
Histological documentation of mCRC
Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate within one year of study entry; evaluation can happen outside of MD Anderson as long as histological confirmation takes place at MD Anderson
Histological diagnostic material available for review.
All patients must have histological proof of malignant cancer, which is metastatic; histological proof may be obtained from the primary tumor or another metastatic site; however, cytology alone is not an acceptable method of diagnosis
Patients with NO elevation of serum and/or CSF HCGB and AFP MUST have histological diagnosis of malignant germ cell tumor (GCT) or germinoma
Histological diagnosis of synovial sarcoma
Histological diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer
Appropriate treatment history for histological entity.
Histological diagnosis of ATC made through surgical resection is also acceptable.
For Part B: All participants must have a histological evidence of their advanced or metastatic cancer and prescreened alterations in a defined pathway.
For Part D: All participants must have histological evidence of advanced or metastatic cancer and prescreened alterations in a defined pathway.
