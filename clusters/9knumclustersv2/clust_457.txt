Serum bilirubin less than two times the institutional upper limits of normal (ULN); higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, or Gilberts disease
Serum bilirubin =< . times ULN except for participants who are on atazanavir or indinavir, provided that the participants direct bilirubin is within normal institutional limits
Have adequate organ function, including: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at least . x /Liter (L), platelets at least  x /L, and hemoglobin at least  grams/deciliter (g/dL); bilirubin no more than . times upper limits of normal; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) no more than . times upper limits of normal; Serum creatinine no more than . times upper limits of normal or calculated creatinine clearance > milliliters/minute (mL/min)
Hepatic dysfunction defined as a bilirubin >. times the upper normal limits, LDH, SGOT and SGPT> times upper limits of normal or albumin <. g/dL.
Bilirubin =< . times upper limits of normal (ULN)
Liver function criteria: AST and ALT =< . times the institutional upper limits of normal
Performed within  days prior to study: Bilirubin <  times the upper limits of the institutional normal
Total bilirubin within =< . times the upper limit of normal (ULN) institutional limits
Total bilirubin within  times the upper limits of normal
Liver function tests >=  times the institutional upper limits of normal
Bilirubin =< . times ULN (if total bilirubin elevated, but direct is within normal limits [WNL], patient is eligible)
Total bilirubin within . times the upper limit of normal institutional limits
Hepatic Function: Bilirubin ? . times institutional normal; SGPT (ALT) <  times institutional normal
Elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin defined as  times the upper limits of normal
Hepatic enzymes  times greater than the upper limits of normal
