Operable invasive breast cancer
Invasive lobular cancer
Subjects must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer and registration must occur within  months after the first histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer\r\n* A core biopsy interpreted as invasive cancer meets this criterion; if no core biopsy is performed, the date of first histologic diagnosis will be the date of first surgical procedure that identifies invasive cancer (biopsy, lumpectomy or mastectomy)\r\n* Neoadjuvant subjects should have no evidence of clinical T disease prior to chemotherapy and surgery; eligibility for neoadjuvant patients can be defined by either clinical stage prior to therapy or pathologic stage at surgery; if patient is eligible based on either, they are eligible for the study\r\n* Bilateral breast carcinoma is allowed provided either:\r\n** Diagnoses are synchronous  that is, within  months of one another  and at least one of the two breast carcinomas meet the eligibility criteria and neither is Her- positive or inflammatory; OR\r\n** The contralateral breast cancer was at least  years prior to the current diagnosis\r\n* No evidence of metastatic disease
Patients must not have metastatic breast cancer (stage IV disease); patients with multifocal, multicentric, and synchronous bilateral, and primary inflammatory breast cancers are allowed\r\n* Multifocal disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer <  cm from the largest lesion within the same breast quadrant\r\n* Multicentric disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer >=  cm from the largest lesion within the same breast quadrant or more than one lesion in different quadrants\r\n* Synchronous bilateral disease is defined as invasive breast cancer with positive lymph nodes (axillary or intramammary) in at least one breast, diagnosed within  days of each other; (NOTE: the tumor with the highest recurrence score should be used)
Chemotherapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization
Post neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients must be found to have residual invasive cancer in the breast at the time of definitive surgery; residual cancer is defined as a contiguous focus of residual invasive cancer, in the breast, measuring >=  cm in diameter, and with more than minimal cellularity, as per local pathologist determination; please note that in patients that have multifocal or multicentric residual tumors these lesions cannot be added up; the biggest lesion has to measure >=  cm in diameter; this is required due to constraints in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction for PAM analysis\r\n* NOTE: The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) without invasion does not qualify as residual invasive disease in the breast\r\n* NOTE: Despite lymph node involvement if residual invasive cancer in the breast is <  cm in diameter patients are not eligible for participation
No history of TNBC invasive breast cancer within  years of enrollment, no concurrent malignancies of any sort
Pathologic confirmation of invasive breast cancer diagnosed by core needle biopsy
No invasive cancer at the surgical margins
