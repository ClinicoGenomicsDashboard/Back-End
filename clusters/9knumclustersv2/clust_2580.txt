Adequate organ function within  days of study registration ( days for pulmonary and cardiac) as defined in section .
Adequate Cardiac Function defined as shortening fraction of >=% by echocardiogram (while not receiving medications for cardiac function), or ejection fraction of >= % by gated radionuclide study (while not receiving medications for cardiac function), the corrected QTc interval by Bazett's formula (QTcB) < milliseconds (msec), and must not have a history of myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina, peripheral vascular disease or familial QTc prolongation.
