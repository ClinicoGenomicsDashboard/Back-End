Patients who have received histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (including valproic acid, entinostat, vorinostat) are excluded
Patients who have received prior histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, or brentuximab vedotin, may be permitted to enter the study unless they have received an HDAC inhibitor or brentuximab within the last  months
HDAC inhibitors:  weeks
Patients with a prior history of treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (e.g., SNDX-/entinostat, LAQ-, LBH, PXD-/belinostat, etc); patients who have received valproic acid will be excluded from this study
Concomitant use of other histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors

Prior treatment for MDS with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors Zolinza (vorinostat), Belenodaq (belinostat), Farydak (panobinostat), Istodax (romidepsin/depsipetide), or investigational agent with significant action as an HDAC inhibitor.
Any previous treatment with a HDAC inhibitor, including citarinostat
Patient had prior treatment with an histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (e.g., romidepsin [Depsipeptide], NSC-, MS , LAQ-, belinostat [PXD-], LBH, MGCD, CRA, etc); patients who have received compounds with HDAC inhibitor-like activity, such as valproic acid, as anti-tumor therapy should not enroll in this study; patients who have received such compounds for other indications, e.g. valproic acid for epilepsy, may enroll after a -day washout period

Prior anti-neoplastic treatment with any HSP or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor compound
Patients receiving histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or compounds with HDAC inhibitor like activity, such as valproic acid, are ineligible; patients who have received such agents may enroll on this study after a -day washout period

Received prior HDAC inhibitor therapy
Patients who have had prior treatment with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (e.g., romidepsin [Depsipeptide], NSC-, MS , LAQ-, belinostat [PXD-], LBH, MGCD, CRA, etc); patients who have received compounds with HDAC inhibitor-like activity, such as valproic acid, as anti-tumor therapy should not enroll in this study; patients who have received such compounds for other indications, e.g. valproic acid for epilepsy, may enroll after a -day washout period
