Urinary protein < + by urine dipstick (if dipstick is >= + then a -hour urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is <  g per  hours)
The patients urinary protein is =< + on dipstick or routine urinalysis (urine analysis [UA]; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is >= +, a -hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate <  mg of protein in  hours to allow participation in this protocol)
The patients urinary protein is =<  positive (+) (=< - mg/dl) on dipstick or routine urinalysis (urinary analysis [UA]; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is >= + (>=- mg/dl), a -hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate <  mg of protein in  hours to allow participation in this protocol)
Urine protein < + on dipstick test or routine urinalysis; if the proteinuria on these tests is >= +, then a -hour urine test must be collected and must demonstrate <  g protein in  hours to allow participation
Urinary protein < + by urine dipstick (if >= +, a -hour urine protein must show protein <  g per  hours)
Proteinuria: if urine dipstick shows + protein,  hour urinary protein should be done and be less than =<  grams/ hours
Urine protein should be screened by urinalysis; if protein is + or higher,  hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be <  mg for patient enrollment
Urine protein must be screened by urine analysis within  days prior to registration; patient must not have greater than + proteinuria on two consecutive dipsticks taken no less than  days apart; however, if the first urinalysis shows no protein, then a repeat urinalysis is not required
Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio < . or urine protein =< + on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA); if UPC >= . or urine dipstick or routine analysis is >= +, a -hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate < , mg of protein in  hours to allow participation in the study
Patients whose urinary protein is =< + on a dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA); if routine analysis is > +, a -hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate <  mg of protein in  hours to allow participation in this protocol)
Have urinary protein ?+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis.
Urinalysis dipstick for urinary protein performed within  days prior to randomization must be -+ protein. If urine dipstick result is greater than or equal to + protein, a -hour urine protein must be less than . g/ hours.
Participant's urinary protein is ? + on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA); if urine protein ? +, a -hour urine collection must demonstrate <  milligrams (mg) of protein in  hours to allow participation in the study
Urine protein must be screened by urinalysis; if protein is + or higher, -hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be <  mg for patient enrollment
Known proteinuria defined by >= + protein by urinalysis (UA) or >=  gram protein by  hour urine collection; Note: Subjects that are >= + or greater on dipstick but <  g protein on  hour urine ARE eligible to participate
Urinary protein is <+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis.
Urinary protein =< + by urine analysis; if urine protein is > + then a -hour urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is <  g per  hours
Urine protein =< + on dipstick or routine urinalysis; if urine dipstick or routine urinalysis indicates proteinuria >= +, then a -hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate <  mg of protein in  hours
Urinary protein =<  mg/dL in urinalysis or =< + on dipstick, unless quantitative protein is <  mg in a  h urine sample
Urinary protein < + (unless total quantitative protein is <  mg protein/day as determined by  hour [H] urine collection)
Quantitative urine protein by dipstick =< 
Urinary protein < + by urine dipstick; if dipstick is >= + then a -hour urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is <  g per  hours
Spot urine must not show + or more protein in urine or the patient will require a repeat urinalysis; if repeat urinalysis shows + protein or more, a -hour urine collection will be required and must show total protein excretion <  mg/ hours
Spot urine must not show + or more protein in urine or the subject will require a repeat urinalysis. If repeat urinalysis shows + protein or more, a -hour urine collection will be required and must show total protein excretion <, mg per  hours.
