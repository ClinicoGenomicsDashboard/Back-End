Unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or need for antiarrhythmic medication for which inability to take an oral preparation of regular medication for  hours would represent an unacceptable risk
Patients must be free of symptoms of uncontrolled cardiac disease including unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia
No active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia and psychiatric disorder
History of a significant medical illness deemed by the principal investigator (PI) as unsuitable for the trial; for example: i. symptomatic congestive heart failure; ii. psychiatric illness/social situation that may make study dangerous; iii. unstable angina pectoris
Has known symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia
The participant has symptomatic congestive heart failure or symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia.

Has known symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia
Participant has uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social situations, or any other serious uncontrolled medical disorders in the opinion of the investigator

Evidence of uncontrolled illness such as symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or unstable angina pectoris.
Symptomatic congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris
Severe cardiovascular disease including symptomatic angina pectoris, symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, or symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV); subjects carrying a diagnosis of congestive heart failure which is asymptomatic are eligible so long as a baseline and follow-up echocardiogram are performed as per the study calendar
Non-controlled intercurrent diseases, including active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable chest angina or heart arrhythmia, as well as mentally incapable patients
Serious non-malignant disease such as active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations or other conditions which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise protocol objectives
Cardiac related illnesses including, but not limited to:\r\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure including participants with grade III/IV cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association functional criteria\r\n* Unstable angina pectoris\r\n* Cardiac arrhythmia
Uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe oxygen dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unstable angina or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia that could jeopardize the subjects ability to receive the chemotherapy described in the protocol safely
History of a significant medical illness deemed by the PI or local investigators as unsuitable for the trial. For example: i. Symptomatic congestive heart failure ii. Psychiatric Illness/social situation that may make study dangerous iii. Unstable angina pectoris
Must not have a serious cardiac condition, such as congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or heart attack within the last  months.
Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure will not be eligible
Any severe concurrent disease or condition (including active, uncontrolled systemic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for study participation
Any medical condition including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study procedures
Symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association II-IV), unstable angina pectoris, or symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia.
Participants with a concurrent active illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, thyroid storm.
