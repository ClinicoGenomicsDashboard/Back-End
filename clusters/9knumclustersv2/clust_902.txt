Have been diagnosed with another primary malignancy other than NSCLC except for adequately treated non-adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ; definitively treated non-metastatic prostate cancer; or patients with another primary malignancy who are definitively relapse-free with at least  years elapsed since the diagnosis of the other primary malignancy.
Concurrent active malignancy, other than adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, other noninvasive carcinoma, or in situ neoplasm; a subject with previous history of malignancy is eligible, provided that he/she has been disease-free for >  years
History of other malignancies within the past  years, other than adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix, unless the other malignancy is quiescent and medical monitor approval is obtained
History of any other malignancy within  years, except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-melanoma skin cancer and/or subjects with indolent second malignancies are eligible
Any active malignancy, other than RCC, for which chemotherapy or other anti-cancer therapy is indicated. Patients with adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for at least  years will be permitted.
Patients with a second malignancy, other than adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ melanoma or in situ cervical cancer. Patients with other non-mammary malignancies must have been disease-free for at least years
Have been diagnosed with another primary malignancy other than NSCLC, except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ; definitively treated non-metastatic prostate cancer; or patients with another primary malignancy who are definitively relapse-free with at least  years elapsed since the diagnosis of the other primary malignancy.
Malignancies that are expected to alter life expectancy or may interfere with disease assessment. Patients with adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer and patients with prior history of malignancy who have been disease free for more than  years are eligible.
Concurrent malignancies that are expected to alter life expectancy (e.g., NSCLC, etc.) or that may interfere with assessment of prostate cancer (e.g., lymphoma involving the periaortic nodes). Patients with adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma, and patients with prior history of malignancy who have been disease-free for more than  years are eligible
Prior history of invasive cancer within  years before screening, except for adequately treated in situ carcinomas or non-melanoma skin cancer
No evidence of prior malignancy except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, adequately treated in situ carcinoma, low grade prostate carcinoma (Gleason grade =< ) managed with observation that has been stable for at least  months, or any malignancy treated with curative intent continuously disease free for >=  years so as not to interfere with interpretation of radiographic response
Subject has a concurrent active malignancy other than adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer or in situ neoplasm
Patient has a concurrent active malignancy; malignancies treated with a curative intent with an expected life expectancy >=  years or a non-competing life expectancy risk are eligible (i.e. adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma, non-melanomatous skin cancer, early stage breast cancer, treated prostate cancer or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for >=  years)
Patient has a history of other malignancy treated with curative intent within the previous  years with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with previous invasive cancers are eligible if the treatment was completed more than  years prior to initiating current study treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease.
Have been diagnosed with another primary malignancy within the past  years (except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ, or prostate cancer, which are allowed within  years).
Prior malignancy unless curatively treated and disease-free for >  years prior to study entry. Prior adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer of the cervix, DCIS or stage I grade  endometrial cancer allowed.
Previous malignant disease within the last  years with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer
Prior malignancy, except for non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of any site, or other cancers for which the patient has been adequately treated and disease free for  years
