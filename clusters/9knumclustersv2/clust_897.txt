Specific Criteria by Stratum: Stratum : All patients must have completed standard upfront therapy that replicates treatment which patients who were enrolled on ANBL received, including: intensive induction chemotherapy and (if feasible) resection of primary tumor, followed by: consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant and radiotherapy, followed by: immunotherapy with Ch./IL-/GM-CSF (dinutuximab) and retinoic acid;. All subjects on Stratum  must have also met the following criteria:  A pre-transplant disease status evaluation that met International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) for CR (complete response), VGPR (very good partial response), or PR (partial response) for primary site, soft tissue metastases and bone metastases. Patients who meet those criteria must also meet the protocol-specified criteria for bone marrow response prior to transplant as outlined below: No more than % tumor involvement (based on total nucleated cellular content) seen on any specimen from a bilateral bone marrow aspirate/biopsy. Stratum : Neuroblastoma that is in first complete remission following standard upfront therapy different from that described for Stratum . Stratum : Neuroblastoma that failed to have a response of at least PR following induction chemotherapy and surgical resection of the primary tumor, but that has achieved CR following additional therapy. Stratum : Patients who have achieved a second or subsequent CR following relapse(s).
