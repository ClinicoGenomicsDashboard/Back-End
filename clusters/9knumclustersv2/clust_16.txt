Serum creatinine > . x OR creatinine clearance of at least 
Patient may not have severe renal disease (creatinine greater than  times normal for age OR creatinine clearance <  ml/m^/. m^)
Serum creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ? milliliters/minute/. m^, based on a  or  hours (h) urine creatinine collection.
Creatinine clearance above limits set in the protocol for each cohort
Creatinine clearance of >= 
The patient must have a corrected creatinine clearance >= % of normal
Patients must have a creatinine and AST =< grade 
Creatinine =< grade 
Creatinine < . and creatinine clearance > 
Creatinine clearance < 
Serum creatinine =< . x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) of >= 
Creatinine clearance of  or greater
Patients with a creatinine clearance of less than  are ineligible
Creatinine clearance > 
Kidney disease with a calculated creatinine clearance <% normal value.
