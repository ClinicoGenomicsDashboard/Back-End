Fasting serum triglyceride level =<  mg/dL
Severely impaired renal or hepatic function (eg, serum creatinine level >  mg/dL [. ?mol/L], blood urea nitrogen level > mg/dL [. mmol/L], serum aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level > times the upper limit of normal [ULN], or serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level >  times ULN).

Normal serum sodium level without need for supplementation
Triglyceride level of no more than  mg/dL
patients who have a minimum hemoglobin level of 
(OH) D level less than  ng/ml within  months of initiation of study; most recent  hydroxy D level within last  months would be used
hemoglobin level lower than  g/dL (. mmol/L) or platelet count <x^/L or history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia;
Screening CLECA level ? %;
A patient weight that would require exceeding a maximum total allowable dose of I-MIBG at the assigned dose level; the study committee will discuss treating such patients at a lower dose level if six patients have not yet been treated at that lower dose level
Hemoglobin level < . g/dL
Hemoglobin level: must be greater than  g/dL
The cell dose (based on CAR transduced cells) for the second infusion shall not be greater than the current dose level completed or the MTD if this has been determined and not less than the first dose level of this study ( x ^/kg)
Hemoglobin level >= . g/dl
Hemoglobin level at least . g/dL at Screening visit
Patients must have a serum erythropoietin level documented before randomization and =<  days before day  of study treatment; NOTE: hemoglobin must be < . g/dL at time that serum erythropoietin is drawn

Serum triglyceride level =<  mg/dL (=< . mmol/L)
Baseline hemoglobin level of > . g/dl
Triglyceride level of no more than  mg/dL
Patients with plasma creatinine level greater than . mg/dL
Patients must have documented hemoglobin level of g/dL or higher
Be diagnosed with PHPT (inappropriate PTH level in the setting of a high or high-normal serum calcium level greater than or equal to . mg/dL).
Serum bilirubin < . x upper limit of normal (ULN) (maximum level based on MD Anderson laboratory ranges is . mg/dL)
Anticipating surgery, history of hypothyroidism, profound anemia (hemoglobin level of <  g/dL =<  days prior to registration), or clinical depression per physician discretion
Fibrinogen level <  mg/dl
Hemoglobin level of at least  g/dL (transfusion is allowed to achieve hemoglobin level of at least  g/dL).
Patients with plasma creatinine level greater than . mg/dL
Hemoglobin level of >=  g/dL
Pregnancy as assessed on baseline blood hCG level
Hemoglobin of >= g/dl within  weeks of enrollment; if the patient has not had blood drawn for a hemoglobin level in the past two weeks, one will be done to determine the eligibility
Patients with plasma creatinine level greater than . mg/dL
Hemoglobin of >=  g/dl within  weeks of enrollment; if the patient has not had blood drawn for a hemoglobin level in the past two weeks, one will be done to determine the eligibility
A hemoglobin level < g/dl
Have a hemoglobin level of >=  g/dL within  weeks of enrollment
Hemoglobin level of >=  g/dL within  weeks of enrollment; if the patient has not had blood drawn for a hemoglobin level in the previous two weeks, one will be performed to determine eligibility; patients with a hemoglobin level < g/dL will be referred for treatment of anemia
Patients with hypertriglyceridemia with serum triglyceride level >=  mg/d (lipid lowering drugs may be used to control level)
Patients must have hemoglobin level >= gm/dl (age adjusted if appropriate) provided by the reference laboratory performing the test
