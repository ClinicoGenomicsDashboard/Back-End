Patients with > grade  sensory peripheral neuropathy.
Preexisting sensory neuropathy Grade ? 
Peripheral neuropathy >= grade  sensory neuropathy or >= grade  sensory neuropathy with pain within  days of registration; prior neuropathy of this severity improved due to medical management such as gabapentin are potentially eligible

Patients must not have > grade sensory neuropathy
No baseline peripheral sensory neuropathy >= grade 
Patients with evidence of >= grade  peripheral sensory neuropathy
Pre-existing grade >=  peripheral sensory neuropathy

Patients must not have grade  or greater peripheral sensory neuropathy
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must not have grade  or greater peripheral sensory neuropathy
Sensory peripheral neuropathy >= grade 
Subject has known peripheral sensory neuropathy > Grade  unless the absence of deep tendon reflexes is the sole neurological abnormality.

Preexisting sensory grade >=  neuropathy
Current peripheral sensory neuropathy > grade 
Existence of peripheral sensory neuropathy >= grade  (from any cause)
Patients with grade  sensory neuropathy at baseline
Patient has >= grade  peripheral sensory neuropathy or >= grade  painful sensory neuropathy within  days before enrollment; (NOTE: patient with peripheral neuropathy [PN] that was previously this severe but is currently improved due to ongoing therapy [e.g., gabapentin or amitriptyline] may be eligible)
