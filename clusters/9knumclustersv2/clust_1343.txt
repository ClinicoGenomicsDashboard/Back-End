Histologically confirmed diagnosis of secretory multiple myeloma (must have measurable M protein in serum or urine) with at least one of the following:
Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant secretory or non-secretory pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma that is unresectable and deemed inappropriate for alternative local regional therapeutic approaches
Non-secretory or hyposecretory multiple myeloma, prior to initial treatment defined as < . g/dL M-protein in serum, <  mg/ hr urine M-protein, and no measurable disease as per IMWG by Freelite
Non-secretory multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma: stage II or III, symptomatic, secretory multiple myeloma requiring treatment
Participants with non-secretory or oligo-secretory myeloma, plasma cell leukemia or Waldenstrm's macroglobulinemia
Non-secretory multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma: stage II or III, symptomatic, secretory multiple myeloma requiring treatment
Patients with non-secretory multiple myeloma are not eligible
Symptomatic, previously untreated (with exception of corticosteroids) secretory myeloma
Diagnosis of non-secretory myeloma
Has non-secretory multiple myeloma
Non-secretory or oligo-secretory MM
Has non-secretory or oligosecretory multiple myeloma
Confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma and measurable secretory disease
Non-secretory multiple myeloma.
Non-secretory or oligo-secretory Multiple Myeloma (Phase II only; such disease is permissible in Phase I).
Subjects with non-secretory or oligo-secretory or serum free light-chain only myeloma
Multiple myeloma: stage II or III, symptomatic, secretory multiple myeloma requiring treatment
Patients with non-secretory or hyposecretory MM
Multiple myeloma that does not express M-protein or FLC (i.e., non-secretory MM is excluded), and quantitative immunoglobulin levels cannot be used instead.
