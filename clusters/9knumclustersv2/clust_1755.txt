Patients with any pulmonary infiltrate including those suspected to be of infectious origin; in particular, patients with resolution of clinical symptoms of pulmonary infection but with residual pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray are not eligible until pulmonary infiltrates have completely resolved
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest CT scan that has not been cleared by Pulmonary. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections)
No evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest X-ray or chest CT scan unless cleared for study by pulmonary; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections)
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest X-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan unless cleared for study by Pulmonary; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections)
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest X-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan unless cleared for study by pulmonary; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections)
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan unless cleared for study by pulmonary; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections)
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates; progressive pulmonary infiltrate is defined as an increase of % or greater from prior radiologic exam; radiologic assessment methods may be computed tomography (CT) or posterioranterior (PA)/lateral (L) x-ray imaging; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable or improving after  week of appropriate therapy, or  weeks for presumed or proven fungal infections to be eligible
New progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan that have not been evaluated with bronchoscopy; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or proven fungal infections)
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan unless cleared for study by pulmonary. Infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections).
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan that has not been evaluated with bronchoscopy; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections); surgical resection waives any waiting requirements
New progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan for which evaluation with bronchoscopy is not feasible; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections)
Patients with an abnormal chest X-ray and/or any pulmonary infiltrate including those suspected to be of infectious origin; in particular, patients with resolution of clinical symptoms of pulmonary infection but with residual pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray are not eligible until pulmonary infiltrates have completely resolved
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan that has not been evaluated with bronchoscopy, if feasible; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections); surgical resection waives any waiting requirements
New or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on screening chest x-ray or chest computed tomography (CT) scan that has not been evaluated with bronchoscopy, if feasible; infiltrates attributed to infection must be stable/improving (with associated clinical improvement) after  week of appropriate therapy ( weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections)
