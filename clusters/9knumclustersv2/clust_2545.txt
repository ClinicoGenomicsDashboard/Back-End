Histologically confirmed triple negative breast cancer(TNBC) that is either locally recurrent, inoperable and cannot be treated with curative intent or is metastatic

COHORT  (TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER [TNBC])
Locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic TNBC or triple negative inflammatory breast cancer.
Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic triple negative breast cancer
Subjects must have received no more than  prior therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer
Metastatic or unresectable AR+ triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); AR positivity assessed centrally and defined as immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of >% of tumor nuclei.
Diagnosis of triple-negative or ER-negative breast cancer
HER/neu positive or estrogen and progesterone receptor negative breast cancer; patients with triple negative breast cancer are also excluded
At least  HER-negative breast cancer patients will be enrolled in this cohort
Women already undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat their primary triple negative breast cancer
Histological documentation of advanced solid tumor, other than triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
Triple-negative tumours, i.e. tumour cells are negative for
Histologically confirmed invasive triple negative Breast Cancer
For the dose expansion cohort, participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of either:\r\n* Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer of high grade serous histology which has recurred despite standard therapy; up to  prior lines in the platinum resistant setting (i.e. up to  lines after patients have become platinum resistant); patients may have received unlimited lines while platinum sensitive\r\n* Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) which has recurred despite standard therapy; recurrent TNBC needs to have metastatic disease and patients with an in breast recurrence are not eligible; up to  prior lines in the recurrent setting for patients with triple-negative breast cancer are allowed
Pre- or post-menopausal women with stage I and II breast cancer, triple negative tumors (upper limit of positivity < % for estrogen receptors, < % for progesterone receptors)
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Cohort : Participants must have triple negative breast cancer.
Patients enrolled on the expansion portion of the study will consist of two cohorts: those patients who are triple-negative, BRCA-mutant positive and those patients who have triple-negative, non-BRCA mutated breast cancer
triple-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) defined as histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer and must have received at least  chemotherapy-containing regimen for advanced disease (recurrent or metastatic). Tumour must be triple-negative, defined as minimal or no expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors [<% of cells positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC)], and minimal or no expression of HER (IHC staining  or + or FISH-).
Metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
For maximum tolerated dose (MTD) Dose Expansion: Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed triple-negative breast cancer who had undergone within  lines of systemic anti-cancer treatment and not eligible for standard therapy anymore.
Cohort : Has triple negative breast cancer, is considered for cohort  participation, and received prior anthracycline therapy
For the expansion cohort: women with histologically or cytologically confirmed TNBC (triple negative breast cancer)
Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except breast cancer (however, triple negative will be included), liposarcoma, CRPC, melanoma and teratoma) or hematological malignancy (except mantle cell lymphoma).
Previously treated metastatic triple negative breast cancer that expresses Notch with at least one measurable lesion
Part  includes advanced triple negative breast cancer patients.
Expansion phase only: Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who were refractory to or had exhausted all available therapies. Subjects had to have evaluable or measurable disease (as per RECIST . or Cheson  criteria).
Subjects with non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are preferred
For the dose expansion cohort, patients with triple-negative breast cancer may not be breast cancer / (BRCA/) germline mutation carriers
Triple negative breast cancer
Patients with tumors of two different subtypes will be eligible provided that the triple negative tumor otherwise meets eligibility requirements, and the non-triple negative tumor is < . cm in size
Criteria, Participant provided informed consent prior to any study-specific activities/procedures -Criteria , Confirmation of triple negative breast cancer or colorectal cancer with liver metastases by laboratory testing
