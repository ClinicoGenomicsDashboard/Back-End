Active disease and indication for treatment based on the IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines, defined by presence of at least any one of the following conditions: Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by development or worsening of anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia; Massive (i.e. at least  cm below the left costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly; Massive nodes (i.e. at least  cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy; Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than % over a two-month period or a lymphocyte doubling time of less than  months.
Progressive or massive lymphadenopathy OR
Must have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma as per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IW-CLL)  criteria; specifically, patients must also require therapy for that diagnosis, based on meeting at least one of the following criteria:\r\n* Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia (hemoglobin < . g/L) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets <  x ^/L)\r\n* Massive (>=  cm below the left costal margin), progressive, or symptomatic splenomegaly\r\n* Massive nodes (at least  cm longest diameter), progressive, or symptomatic lymphadenopathy\r\n* Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of more than % over a -month period or lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of <  months; lymphocyte doubling time may be obtained by linear regression extrapolation of absolute lymphocyte counts obtained at intervals of  weeks over an observation period of  to  months; in subjects with initial blood lymphocyte counts of <  x ^/L, LDT should not be used as a single parameter to define indication for treatment; in addition, factors contributing to lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy other than CLL (e.g., infections) should be excluded\r\n* Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to corticosteroids or other standard therapy\r\n* Documented constitutional symptoms, defined as  or more of the following disease-related symptoms or signs:\r\n** Unintentional weight loss > % within  months prior to screening\r\n** Significant fatigue (inability to work or perform usual activities) fevers > . degrees Fahrenheit (F) or . degrees Celsius (C) for  or more weeks prior to screening without evidence of infection\r\n** Night sweats for more than  month prior to screening without evidence of infection
