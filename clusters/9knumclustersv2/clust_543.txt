Has received prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant within the last  days
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in second or third complete remission, or relapse (including relapse post autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant); relapsed double hit lymphomas; patients with options for treatment that are known to be curative are not eligible
Hodgkin's disease (HD): Induction failures, after first complete remission, or relapse (including relapse post autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant), or those with active disease
Mantle cell lymphoma patients who are beyond first remission and previously treated with chemoimmunotherapy; patients who have relapsed following autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are eligible

Prior autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
Patients must not have a prior autologous, syngeneic or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
History of relapsed or refractory CD+ malignancies (e.g. non Hodgkin lymphoma) who have failed prior treatment and require autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant; evidence of disease not required (cohort )
Multiple myeloma (MM) stage II or III patients who have progressed after an initial response to chemotherapy or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or MM patients with refractory disease who may benefit from tandem autologous-nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant
Stem cells from an identical donor could be used for autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
Hodgkin's disease (HD): induction failures, second or third complete remission, or relapse (including relapse post autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant)
Evidence of multiple myeloma disease progression (as defined by IMWG) any time prior to autologous (auto)-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
Prior allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the last  months
Unless approved by the medical monitor, may not have received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant within  months before treatment
Autologous hematopoietic cell infusion after high dose therapy At least  days

Received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant within the last  months
Prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant ?  months.
Research participant did not have evidence of disease progression after salvage therapy and therefore underwent an autologous myeloablative transplantation with hematopoietic progenitor cell autologous (HPC[A]) rescue procedure
