National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend for metastatic breast cancer biopsy documentation of first recurrence, if possible, and determination of hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) and HER status.; therefore, histologic and/or cytologic confirmation of metastatic disease is encouraged whenever feasible, but not required; in some circumstances, histologic confirmation may not be feasible (eg, bone metastases not amenable to biopsy and elevated cancer antigen [CA]- tumor marker); for patients who have had histologic confirmation of metastatic disease, it is required that the biopsy confirm that the metastatic tumor is ER and/or PR positive, and HER/neu negative; for patients in whom biopsy confirmation of metastatic disease is not feasible, it is required that the primary tumor be ER and/or PR-positive and HER/neu negative
