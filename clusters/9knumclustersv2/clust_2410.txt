Diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma
Prostate adenocarcinoma (PAC)

Does not have a diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma
Histologic confirmation of diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate will be required by biopsy
Documented pathologic confirmation of prostate adenocarcinoma
Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate obtained within  months of screening; patients in whom a diagnosis of high-risk localized or locally-advanced prostatic adenocarcinoma is suspected based on a serum PSA >  ng/mL or clinical T disease by digital rectal examination, but who have not yet undergone diagnostic prostate biopsy, will be eligible for screening and initial MRI and targeted prostate cancer biopsies which will be obtained at the same time as diagnostic biopsies; those patients in whom the diagnostic biopsies confirm prostatic adenocarcinoma will be permitted to continue with study treatment if they meet all additional eligibility criteria
Patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate that in the opinion of the urologist could be resected after response to systemic therapy; ductal adenocarcinoma is permitted
Patients with cytologic evidence of adenocarcinoma in situ
Histological or cytologic evidence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate confirmed at local institution

Patients with verrucous or adenocarcinoma
Prior to randomization, have histological confirmation that CRC lesions were adenocarcinoma (subtypes of adenocarcinoma, e.g. mucinous adenocarcinoma are allowed). Subjects with CRC lesions of other histological types, including mixed type with predominant adenocarcinoma, will not be eligible to be randomized to study treatment.
The subject has a proven histologic diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma, but may have undergone prior surgery and/or radiation
