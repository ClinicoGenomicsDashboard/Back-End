Potential patients referred for the study may not be eligible for the experimental protocol therapy due to reasons such as uncertainty about donor HLA typing or need to control malignant disease, infection, or metabolic abnormality such as hypercalcemia on an emergent basis; should a referred patient present to us in such a scenario, the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for treatment; however, if referral back to the referring physician is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease or complicating conditions (infection, metabolic problems) under the current study; in other cases, a patient may have reasonable control of malignancy but does not meet the CD cell cut-off of  cells per microliter required for cohort  therapy (or, absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] value of < ); in such cases, standard care chemotherapy regimens may be administered for the specific goal of reducing the CD count (that is, immune depleting regimens such as the pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide combination, administered similar to the manner that we have developed on protocol -C-); if it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to experimental therapy, then he/she must come off study; recipient-subjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol; because such standard care therapy is not experimental, it is not necessary to complete the eligibility criteria prior to receiving such standard care; however, prior to initiation of the experimental therapy, the patient must meet each of the eligibility criteria detailed above; attempts will be made to standardize such pre-transplant chemotherapy (by administration of EPOCH-FR chemotherapy); however, other regimens using approved agents will be allowed if such regimens are thought to be in the best interest of the patient
