Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer must also meet the following criteria: a. Must be either platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory according to the following definitions:()Platinum-resistant: a response to platinum therapy followed by progression within  months after completing therapy ()Platinum-refractory: best response of stable disease or progression during platinum therapy; b. Must have had prior systemic treatment with a taxane; c. Must have received no more than  prior systemic cytotoxic regimens
Patient must have suspected platinum-resistant disease (disease progression =<  months of platinum therapy)
Platinum-sensitive SCLC after having received up to two prior lines of anticancer therapy, including at least one prior line of a platinum (monotherapy or platinum containing chemotherapy regimen). Patients are eligible only if they had a response (partial or complete) to their most recent platinum and their disease progressed greater than  days after completing their most recent platinum. Patients may have received another non-platinum containing regimen, such as topetecan, immunotherapy, or an investigational agent, as their most recent line of therapy, so long as they are deemed platinum sensitive per the above definition.
If the participant has received prior therapy with platinum, the time to the first treatment of study drug from the last platinum exposure is > days.
If the participant has received prior therapy with platinum, the time to the first treatment of study drug from the last platinum exposure is > days.
Documented platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory disease. Platinum-resistant disease is defined as progression within <  months from completion of a minimum of  platinum frontline therapy cycles in the pre or postoperative setting (the date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum agent). Platinum-refractory is defined as disease that has recurred/progressed while receiving platinum-based frontline therapy.
