Presence of skeletal, and/or soft-tissue/visceral/nodal metastasis
have visceral crisis
No current evidence of visceral crisis or lymphangitic spread
No visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread or known brain metastases: visceral crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases, but implies severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory studies, and rapid progression of disease
Visceral (ie, liver or lung) metastases as only sites of metastases
Presence of unstable systemic disease (e.g., visceral crisis or rapid progression) in the judgment of the investigator
Have visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
Pending visceral crisis, in the opinion of the treating investigator
Visceral (eg, lung, liver) metastatic disease. Adenopathy is allowed;
Has rapid progression of visceral disease and, thus is a candidate for docetaxel; this determination will be at the discretion of the treating physician
Histologic diagnosis of melanoma with metastatic disease to a visceral organ (lung, liver, brain, adrenal, nodal station outside the regional lymph drainage of the primary, vertebral bodies)
A visceral metastasis greater than  cm
A visceral metastasis that due to its location cannot be safely treated with SABR
Have visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis visceral crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases but implies severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory studies, and rapid progression of the disease
History of visceral metastasis, or presence of visceral metastasis detected by screening imaging examinations
History of visceral metastasis, or visceral metastases
History of visceral metastasis, or visceral metastases
COHORT B: Visceral metastatic disease
Patients experiencing a visceral crisis including severe organ dysfunction as assessed by > grade (Gr)  symptomatic toxicities, laboratory studies, and/or rapid progression of disease originating from visceral metastasis
Symptomatic liver or visceral organ metastasis
Patients with rapidly progressive or extensive symptomatic visceral metastatic disease
Pending visceral crisis, in the opinion of the treating investigator
