In order to prevent tumor lysis syndrome, acute leukemia patients must have a peripheral blast count under  x ^/L; this should be achieved with hydroxyurea cytoreduction, prior to starting DT
White blood cell count > , per micro liter (/L); hydroxyurea may be used to control the level of circulating leukemic blast cell counts prior to study entry and, if needed, concomitantly while on TAK- treatment during the first  days of the study. Hydroxyurea can be used up to a maximum dose of  gram per (g/) day.
