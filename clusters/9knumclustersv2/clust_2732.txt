Primary immunodeficiency and need for chronic steroid therapy, exception: patients on chronic physiological dose of steroid equivalent to prednisone <  mg/day is allowed
Have received systemic corticosteroids (used in the management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses) within one week prior to first dose; Note: systemic steroid therapy is allowed for subjects on replacement therapy as long as prednisone =<  mg or its steroid equivalent, and those patients should continue at the same dose through the trial
