Active dental or jaw condition which requires oral surgery
Current active dental problems including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or mandibular); dental or fixture trauma, or a current or prior diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), of exposed bone in the mouth, or of slow healing after dental procedures
Recent (within  weeks) or planned dental or jaw surgery (e.g. extraction, implants)
