Has had esophageal or gastric variceal bleeding within the last  months; all subjects will be screened for esophageal varices, unless such screening has been performed in the past  months before first dose of treatment; if varices are present, they should be treated according to institutional standards before starting study treatment
A history of Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade  bleeding esophageal or gastric varices within the past  months; prior variceal bleed is permitted if patient has undergone banding or sclerotherapy and there has been no evidence of bleeding for  months; patients at risk for varices (based on the following: known history of esophageal or gastric varices; evidence of hepatic cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension including biopsy-proven cirrhosis, hypersplenism, or radiographic findings of varices) will be screened (using either esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD] or capsule endoscopy) for esophageal varices, unless such screening has been performed in the past two years from study entry and the patient is receiving medical treatment for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, such as non-selective beta blockade; if varices are identified that require intervention (banding), patient will not be eligible until varices are adequately treated; patients presenting with gastric varices will not be eligible for the study
Known varices at risk of bleeding, including medium or large esophageal or gastric varices, or active peptic ulcer.
History of moderate or severe ascites, bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy or pleural effusions related to liver insufficiency within  months of screening
A history of variceal bleeding where the varices have not been eradicated or decompressed by shunt placement
Current unstable liver or biliary disease per investigator assessment defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis.
Clinical evidence of portal hypertension with bleeding esophageal or gastric varices at Screening, or within  months before randomization
Evidence of severe portal hypertension by history, endoscopy, or radiologic studies\r\n* Note: any diagnosis of portal hypertension or clinical stigmata of such including but not limited to gastric or esophageal varices, umbilical vein varices or telangiectasias
History of high grade esophageal or gastric varices
History of high grade esophageal or gastric varices
Gastric or esophageal varices that require interventional treatment within  days prior to randomization. Prophylaxis with pharmacologic therapy (eg, nonselective beta-blocker) is permitted.
Portosystemic hypertension or known history of bleeding esophageal varices.
Subject has a history of bleeding esophageal varices within  months before the Day  visit.
Patients who have radiographic evidence of esophageal varices or history of variceal hemorrhage
Bleeding esophageal or gastric varices within  days prior to treatment initiation
Esophageal or gastric varices
For subjects with known or suspected cirrhosis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy ) within  months of signing the informed consent form, showing no evidence of untreated varices or stigmata of active bleeding (such as active ulcer, visible vessel, or blood) is required. Subjects with history of upper GI bleeding must have an EGD of  months or less prior to signing the consent form confirming adequate prior endoscopic therapy (eg, no evidence of any untreated varices, recent or active bleeding, stigmata suggesting high risk for bleeding, active ulcer). Subjects with history/suspected esophageal varices must be on optimal medical management (eg, proton pump inhibitor and non-selective beta-blocker) per local institutional policy.

Known bleeding diathesis, esophageal varices, or angioplasty
Patients with a history of bleeding varices in previous  year are excluded (unless patient has subsequently had a liver transplant); those with gastric varices or varices that are deemed as high risk by the endoscopist should be placed on appropriate medical therapy as advised by the gastroenterologist
