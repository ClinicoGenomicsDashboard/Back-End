History of gastric or duodenal ulcers or untreated hyperacidity syndromes
Symptomatic evidence of gastric outlet obstruction
Subject has gastric outlet syndrome or persistent/recurrent vomiting.
Subject with recent gastric bleeding or symptomatic subjects with proven gastric ulcers that would exclude the subject from participation.
Must have operable gastric adenocarcinoma, T-Ta, N-N, M
History of gastric or small bowel surgery.
History of gastric or small bowel surgery involving any extent of gastric or small bowel resection.
Her- positive gastric tumor
No uncontrolled gastric ulcer disease (grade  gastric ulcer disease) within  days of registration

Gastric Cancer
Diagnosis of squamous or undifferentiated gastric cancer
Malabsorption, total gastric resection
Participant has active, high risk bleeding (such as, via gastric ulcers or gastric varices) within  days prior to randomization
The participant has squamous cell or undifferentiated gastric cancer.
Squamous cell or undifferentiated gastric cancer
Active uncontrolled gastric or duodenal ulcer
Gastric or duodenal ulcer (at least  mm in size) within  mm of expected endoscopy puncture site(s) for photodynamic therapy (PDT)
Gastric cancer (including gastric and EGJ cancers): at least  prior systemic regimens in adjuvant, advanced, or metastatic setting and, as appropriate, a human epidermal growth factor receptor  (HER) targeted agent.
More than one prior line of therapy for advanced gastric cancer
For subjects with gastric cancer:
Prior gastric surgery, small bowel resection, or other conditions that may impede adequate absorption of oral study drug
