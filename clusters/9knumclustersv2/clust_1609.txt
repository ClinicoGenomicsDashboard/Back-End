Part E: Have insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes or a history of gestational diabetes
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
Patients with diabetes mellitus are eligible if they require oral agents only and have a fasting blood glucose =<  mg/dL; patients with a history of diabetes mellitus who require daily long-acting or mealtime insulin are not eligible; patients who have previously required treatment for hyperglycemia due to steroids or other medications are eligible as long as they have not required insulin or any other oral agent within  months prior to study enrollment

Patients who are taking other insulin secretagogues and/or insulin
Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with type  diabetes mellitus are eligible if adequate control of blood glucose level is obtained by oral anti-diabetics as documented by hemoglobin Ac (HbAc) <%.
Patients with diabetes mellitus requiring concurrent treatment with insulin or thiazolidinedione (TZD) oral agents are not eligible
Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or a history of gestational diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes is not exclusionary provided the patient is not maintained with either oral medications or insulin
History of insulin-dependent or uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus
Subjects with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment or subjects with a HbAC >
Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with a type  diabetes mellitus are eligible if adequate control of blood glucose level is obtained by oral anti-diabetics.
Patients with uncontrolled diabetes or insulin resistance
Patients with diabetes requiring insulin or requiring more than one non-insulin hypoglycemia agents
Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with a type  diabetes mellitus are eligible if adequate control of blood glucose level is obtained by oral anti-diabetics as documented by hemoglobin Ac <%.

Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus uncontrolled with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or metformin use
Diabetes (defined by being on oral hypoglycemics or insulin)
Endocrine disorders such as primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, hyper- or hypothyroidism not controlled with medication, or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
Diabetics requiring insulin treatment
Participant has known diabetes mellitus - insulin treated
Previous or current treatment with any insulin regimen other than basal insulin, e.g. prandial or pre-mixed insulin (short term treatment due to intercurrent illness including gestational is allowed at the discretion for the investigator).
Uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus).
Patients with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin secretagogues and/or insulin
Patients with diabetes who are taking insulin or oral agents
Insulin requiring diabetes (telephone directed diet and physical activity changes would be difficult in this population without close coordination with the treating physician). Non-insulin requiring diabetics are eligible for the study.
Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes
Insulin?dependent diabetes (contraindication for glucagon IV, required for endorectal MRI only)
Subjects with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
