History of brain involvement with cancer, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered for at least  days prior to randomization
Known central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; patients with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered for at least  days prior to the start of study drug
History of brain involvement with cancer, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease (Note: Patients with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered over the  days prior to study treatment)
History of brain involvement with cancer, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease; patients with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered for at least  days

Patient with known central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patient is asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered for at least  days)
Known untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases; Note: patients with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered for this purpose =<  days prior to randomization
Patients with spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease are excluded; patients with a history of prior brain metastasis are permitted provided the lesions are fully treated, inactive, and patient is asymptomatic; subjects with new evidence of brain metastasis discovered during screening are allowed as long as the brain lesions have been irradiated; lesions must be stable as evidenced by repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain imaging within  weeks prior to starting study treatment; patients must also be asymptomatic; patient must have had no steroids use for at least  days prior to start of treatment; centrally located tumors with radiographic evidence (computed tomography [CT] or MRI) of local invasion of major blood vessels
History of brain involvement with cancer, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been administered for brain edema for at least  days
