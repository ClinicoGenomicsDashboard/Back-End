Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least  weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least  days prior to first dose of study treatment
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable.
Active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis (treated metastases are permitted, provided the patient is asymptomatic and off steroids for  days)
Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis Note: Patients previously treated for brain metastases may be able to participate provided they are stable
Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, ie, without evidence of progression for at least  weeks by repeat imaging.
Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, ie, without evidence of progression for at least  weeks by repeat imaging, clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least  days prior to first dose of study treatment.
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable brain metastases
Patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable without the use of systemic steroids for at least  weeks prior to study entry
Has known central nervous system (ie, brain and/or spinal cord) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with brain metastases may participate only if they satisfy all of the following:
Patients with known active or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; asymptomatic, treated, and/or stable brain metastases, as measured by subsequent radiologic evaluations at least two months apart, are permitted
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable and are not using steroids for at least  days prior to trial treatment (stereotactic brain radiation therapy to isolated brain metastases does not require washout period providing no steroids are required)
