Absence of donor specific HLA antibodies
HLA typing prior to referral (consultation with HCT physician). If a subject has had HLA typing with accompanying documentation that full siblings were not HLA typed and that a search of the unrelated donor registry was not performed the subject will be considered eligible.

DONOR: HLA mismatched or haploidentical related donors (including st degree relatives and half siblings)\r\n* The donor and recipient must be identical at least one allele of each of the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DQB; a minimum match of / is therefore required, and will be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype
DONOR: When more than one donor is available, the donor with the lowest number of HLA allele mismatches will be chosen, unless there is HLA cross-match incompatibility or a medical reason to select otherwise, in which case donor selection is the responsibility of the principal investigator (PI), in consultation with the immunogenetics laboratory; in cases where there is more than one donor with the least degree of mismatch, donors will be selected based on the most favorable combination of (i) HLA compatibility in cross-match testing and (ii) ABO compatibility; will prioritize the lowest number of mismatches in the host-versus-graft (HVG) direction (to potentially minimize graft rejection risk)
DONOR: For a partially HLA-mismatched transplant, the patient must lack antibodies against donor HLA molecules; specifically, complement dependent cytotoxicity and flow cytometric crossmatch assays must be negative, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of any anti-donor HLA antibody by solid phase immunoassay should be < ; consult with Immunogenetics for the clinical significance of any anti-donor antibody; desensitization to remove anti-donor antibody should only be performed for patients who have no other donor options

The donor and recipient must be HLA identical for at least one antigen (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB. Fulfillment of this criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype, and typing of additional family members is not required.
