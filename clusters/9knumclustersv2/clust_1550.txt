No active second cancers
Subjects with simultaneous primary cancers outside of the oropharynx
Patients with BRAF WT cancers
Other malignancy within last  years other than certain limited skin, cervical, prostate, breast, or bladder cancers
Assessment of HER status in subjects with non-breast/non-gastric cancers may follow local institutional criteria. These criteria should be made available to the Sponsor.
Up to  patients with incurable Squamous cell cancers as follows:
Current history of neoplasm other than the entry diagnosis. Patients with previous cancers treated and cured with local therapy alone may be considered with approval of the Medical Monitor.
