Patients with Gilbert's syndrome will be eligible for the study; the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is suspected in people who have persistent, slightly elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin without any other apparent cause; a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome will be based on the exclusion of other diseases based on the following criteria:\r\n* Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia noted on several occasions\r\n* No evidence of hemolysis (normal hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH])\r\n* Normal liver function tests\r\n* Absence of other diseases associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

Patients with Gilberts syndrome will be eligible for the study; a diagnosis of Gilberts syndrome will be based on the exclusion of other diseases based on the following criteria:\r\n* Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia noted on several occasions\r\n* No evidence of hemolysis (normal hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH])\r\n* Normal liver function tests\r\n* Absence of other diseases associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
