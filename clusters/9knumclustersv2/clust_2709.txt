Active or prior documented autoimmune disease in the last  years. Participants with childhood atopy or asthma, vitiligo, alopecia, Hashimoto syndrome, Grave's disease, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past  years) are not excluded.
Has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.
Participants with any active autoimmune disease (Appendix ) or a documented history of autoimmune disease, poorly controlled asthma or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for participants with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this study.
Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past  years except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.
Participants with any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, poorly controlled asthma or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for participants with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this study.
Active autoimmune disease or a history of known or suspected autoimmune disease with the exception of subjects with isolated vitiligo, treated thyroiditis or resolved childhood asthma/atopy
Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy
Active autoimmune disease, history of autoimmune disease or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications; exceptions include those with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy; subjects with asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this study
Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved asthma/atopy that is treated with broncho-dilators.
Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy
Patients with vitiligo, alopecia, managed hypothyroidism (on stable replacement doses), psoriasis, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, well-controlled asthma and type I diabetes mellitus are NOT excluded
Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.
Subjects with any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy
Subjects with any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy
Subjects must not have history or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, other symptomatic autoimmune disease, documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome requiring systemic treatment in the past  years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents, steroids or immunosuppressive agents) except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy, or evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression.
Ongoing or recent (within  years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk for immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The following are not exclusionary: vitiligo, childhood asthma that has resolved, residual hypothyroidism that required only hormone replacement or psoriasis that does not require systemic treatment.
Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment with in the past  years OR a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease. Note: Participants with vitiligo, Sjgren's syndrome, Type  diabetes, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, hypothyroidism or adrenal or pituitary insufficiency who are stable on hormone replacement, are not excluded.
Subjects with any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy
Active autoimmune disease or a history of known or suspected autoimmune disease with the exception of subjects with isolated vitiligo, treated thyroiditis or resolved childhood asthma/atopy
Has active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of potential autoimmune syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for patients with vitiligo, endocrinopathies, type  diabetes, or patients with resolved childhood asthma/atopy or other syndromes which would not be expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g., drug-related serum sickness or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Patients with mild asthma who require intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) who have not been hospitalized for asthma in the preceding  years will not be excluded from this study.
Any active autoimmune disease or documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo, psoriasis inactive within past  years, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, or thyroid disease controlled by replacement therapy without the need for immunosuppression
Any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of syndrome that requires concomitant use of chronic systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, except for subjects with vitiligo, treated thyroiditis or resolved asthma/atopy.
