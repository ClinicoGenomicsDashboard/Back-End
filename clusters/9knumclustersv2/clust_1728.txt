Regarding non-hematologic organ function, no specific criteria for non-hematologic organ function are specified; however, if moderate-to-severe (major) organ function is present, such should be discussed with the PI, as various degrees of non-hematologic organ dysfunction may compromise either (or both) toxicity and response evaluations; also, if there is concern regarding potential reversibility of any specific organ dysfunction, this issue should also be addressed by consultation with an appropriate sub-specialist
