Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from this study; HIV positive patients not receiving antiretroviral therapy are excluded

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infection is not an exclusion criterion if it is controlled with anti-retroviral drugs that are unaffected by concomitant enzalutamide.
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are excluded from the study; for patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; screening for HIV status will not be performed
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded
Known HIV positive or on active anti-retroviral therapy
Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Anti-retroviral agents are known to have potential adverse pharmacokinetic interactions with nivolumab and/or BMS-. IN addition, patients not on anti-retroviral agents, regardless of HIV viral load, are at increased risk of lethal infections with marrow-suppressive therapy including chemotherapy. Testing for HIV must be performed at sites mandated by local requirements.
