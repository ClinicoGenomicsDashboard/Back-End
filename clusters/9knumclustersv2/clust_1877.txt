Subject has a history of interstitial lung disease, history of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple allergies; any lung disease that may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity
Patients must not have serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or serious psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the subject's safety or the study data integrity; these include, but are not limited to: history of interstitial lung disease, slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple allergies
History of interstitial lung disease, history of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple allergies.
Interstitial lung disease, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis
The patient has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as documented in their medical history.
Patient with a history of interstitial lung disease, history of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis\r\n* History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted
Pulmonary conditions such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis are excluded
Pulmonary conditions, which in the principal investigator's (PIs) opinion would increase the risk of immunotherapy-related pulmonary toxicity, for example, interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, silicosis or sarcoidosis
No prior history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
