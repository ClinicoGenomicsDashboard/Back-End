Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the unknown potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with indoximod, or docetaxel. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy.
Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity as these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between antiretroviral therapy and the investigational agent
Human immunodeficiency (HIV)-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with STA-; in addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

PHASE II: HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with veliparib; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated
HIV-positive subjects with a CD count <  cells/?L are excluded due to the increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive chemotherapy()\r\n* NOTE: subjects with HIV infection and a CD count >=  cells/?L are eligible but combination antiretroviral therapy should be held during administration of chemotherapy due to the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with decita-bine, cytarabine or daunorubicin. Antiretroviral therapy may be resumed  hours after completion of the last dose of induction chemotherapy
Participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA; HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions of combination antiretroviral therapy with study drugs; in addition, these participants are at increased risk of fatal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy
Patients must not have any known immune deficiencies; patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study
Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with bone marrow suppressive therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are excluded from the study; for patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, the potential impact of pharmacokinetic interactions with HCQ and VEM is unknown; appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients with HIV and those receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy in the future
Known HIV positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy; these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy
HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with mFOLFIRINOX. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with bevacizumab. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with vorinostat; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy
