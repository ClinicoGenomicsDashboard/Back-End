Subjects must have been treated with at least  prior therapies including a proteasome inhibitor and a cereblon-binding agent\r\n* Subjects who are refractory to carfilzomib may enroll throughout the trial; carfilzomib refractory status is defined by IMWG criteria: disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within  days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course\r\n* In the twice weekly dosing cohort of the study, enrollment will be limited to patients meeting carfilzomib refractory status\r\n* In the weekly dosing cohort, it will be required that one of the expansion cohorts ( subjects) enrolls carfilzomib refractory subjects and the other ( subjects) enrolls carfilzomib/proteasome inhibitor (PI) naive/sensitive subjects
