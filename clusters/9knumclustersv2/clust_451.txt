Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study; pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal; males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive use two effective methods of birth control- including a medically accepted barrier method of contraceptive method (e.g., male or female condom) for the entire period in which they are receiving protocol therapy; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective double barrier contraceptive method for the entire duration of protocol therapy and for  months (males) and  month (females) after study drug discontinuation
Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study; pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal; males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two methods of birth control- a medically accepted barrier method of contraceptive method (e.g., male or female condom) and a second effective method of birth control-during protocol therapy and for at least  months after the last dose of XL; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two effective contraceptive methods; abstinence in a non-sexually active child will be sufficient birth control
Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method during the time they are receiving the study drug and for  months thereafter; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control; oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study; women of childbearing potential will be given a pregnancy test within  days prior to administration of RAD and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test; pregnancy tests should be repeated every course +/-  days
Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study; pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal; males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two effective methods of birth control, including a medically accepted barrier or contraceptive method (e.g., male or female condom) for the duration of the study; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study; pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal; males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use a highly effective method of contraception during protocol therapy and for at least  months after the last dose of ramucirumab; a highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (that is, <% per year) when used consistently and correctly; barrier methods used alone are not highly effective methods of contraception; for female patients, if a barrier method is used, a hormonal method must be used with it to ensure that pregnancy does not occur; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control; those who become pregnant while on treatment with ramucirumab must discontinue immediately and consult their treating physician
Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded; males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using and effective method of birth control and females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or have a positive (urine or serum) pregnancy test prior to study entry
Pregnant or breastfeeding women will not be entered into this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal studies. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in females who are post-menarchal and of child bearing potential (e.g. female that has not been amenorrheic for at least  consecutive months or surgically sterilized). Males or females of reproductive potential will not participate unless they have agreed to use effective contraception for the entire period in which they are receiving protocol therapy and for at least one month after treatment ends. Effective contraception is defined as intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pill, injections, implants, patch), tubal ligation and partners vasectomy. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method during the period they are receiving the study drug and for  months thereafter; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control; women of childbearing potential will be given a pregnancy test within  days prior to administration of cabozantinib and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study; pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal; males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two methods of birth control- a medically accepted barrier method of contraceptive method (e.g., male or female condom) and a second effective method of birth control- during protocol therapy and for at least  months after the last dose of cabozantinib; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded; males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
 Males and females of reproductive potential who are unwilling to practice highly effective method(s) of birth control while on study through  days (females) and  days (males) after receiving the last dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence (males, females); vasectomy; bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion; or a condom with spermicide (males) in combination with hormonal birth control or intrauterine device (IUD) (females).
Males and females are sterile, postmenopausal, or compliant with a highly effective contraceptive method.
Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method during the period they are receiving the study drug and for  months thereafter; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control; women of childbearing potential will be given a pregnancy test within  days prior to administration of PD- and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
Highly effective methods of birth control for females & males
Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded; pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to enrollment for all females of childbearing potential as per institutional standards (at National Institutes of Health [NIH] subjects  years and older or those showing pubertal development); males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method; abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control
