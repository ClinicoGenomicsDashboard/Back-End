Patients with prior history of QTC prolongation or QTC >  ms on screening ECG will be excluded
Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation (defined as a QTc > ms for males and > ms for females [Fridericia's correction]) or other clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities as assessed by the investigator
Prolongation of QT/ corrected QT (QTc) interval (QTc interval >  ms for males or >  ms for females) using the Fridericia method of QTc analysis.
Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within  days prior to registration according to the following parameters:\r\n* Male patients must have a corrected QT (QTc) =<  ms\r\n* Female patients must have a QTc =<  ms
Corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation greater than  ms
Evidence of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation as defined as QTc using Fredericia's formula (QTcF) >  ms (per Fridericias formula)
Severe conduction abnormality including significant corrected QT (QTc) prolongation >  ms
Prolongation of QTc interval to greater than  ms
Corrected QT (QTc) interval >  ms for men or  ms for women, or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsades de Pointes
Participant has a corrected QT (QTc) interval >  ms or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes
QTc prolongation defined as a QTc greater than or equal to  ms or a prior history of cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or significant ECG abnormalities
Prolongation of corrected QT interval of >  ms
Previously documented and persistent corrected QT (QTc) prolongation (>  ms)
Patient must have an electrocardiogram without evidence of arrhythmia, QT prolongation (corrected QT [QTc] >  ms in males and >  ms in females), or other severe dysfunction within  weeks of registration
Evidence of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation on pre-treatment electrocardiography (ECG) (greater than  ms in males or greater than  ms in females)
Evidence of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation on pretreatment electrocardiography (ECG) (greater than  ms in males or greater than  ms in females)
