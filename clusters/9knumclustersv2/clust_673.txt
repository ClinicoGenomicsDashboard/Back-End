All participants must had measurable disease. Participants with diffuse pontine\n        glioma were eligible without a biopsy after evidence of progressive disease post radiation\n        therapy. Participants with a grade III or grade IV glioma must had pathologic confirmation\n        either at the time of initial diagnosis or at the time of recurrence.\n\n        Participants aged ? years and ? years\n\n        Participants met the body surface area (BSA) requirements to be eligible:\n\n          .

During the Phase  part participants with a BSA ?. m were eligible, however the\n             actual dose of cabazitaxel for these participants were adjusted to a maximum dose\n             calculated with (capped at) the BSA of . m\n\n        Performance status by:\n\n          .
