Adequate blood coagulation function as evidenced by an International Normalized Ratio (INR) ?.
International normalized ratio (INR) <  if off of anti-coagulation; patients on anti-coagulation therapy with an INR >  may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator if they have not had any episodes of severe hemorrhage
