Participants must have histologically confirmed intracranial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma following maximum surgical resection; tumors primarily localized in the infratentorial compartment will be excluded

Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma that is progressive or recurrent following radiation therapy and temozolomide
Arm  patients must be in first recurrence of glioblastoma following radiation therapy and temozolomide
Histologically confirmed glioblastoma. A local pathology report constitutes adequate documentation of histology for study inclusion. Patients with an initial diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma are eligible if a subsequent biopsy was determined to be glioblastoma.
First or second progression of Glioblastoma;
Histopathologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma prior to registration by pathology report

Histologically confirmed glioblastoma
Glioblastoma or gliosarcoma in first or second recurrence only
Prior radiation or chemotherapy for glioblastoma or glioma.
Prior treatment for glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.
Prior treatment with a PIK and/or mTOR inhibitors for glioblastoma or for pre-existing neoplasm transformed to glioblastoma (applicable for combination treatment arm only)
Glioblastoma or gliosarcoma disease with leptomeningeal spread
Prior chemotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma with nitrosourea compounds or bevacizumab
Participants with glioblastoma are eligible for this study; these will include\r\n* Those with a histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma who have developed new changes on MRI following primary treatment\r\n* Those who received primary treatment for a histologically proven lower grade ( or ) glioma and who now progress with radiographic characteristics of transformed glioma
Patients will be eligible if the original histology was lower grade glioma and a subsequent diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made.
