Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive (+) patients; EXCEPTION: if they meet the following additional criteria =<  days prior to registration:\r\n* CD cells >= /mm^\r\n* Viral load of <  copies HIV messenger (m) ribonucleic acid (RNA)/mm^ if on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or < , copies HIV mRNA if not on cART\r\n No zidovudine or stavudine as part of cART
Patients who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) are eligible providing they meet all of the following additional criteria within  days prior to registration:\r\n* Cluster of differentiation (CD) cells >= /mm^\r\n* Viral load of <  copies HIV messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)/mm^ if on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or < , copies HIV mRNA if not on cART\r\n* No zidovudine or stavudine as part of cART\r\n* Patients who are HIV+ and do not meet all of these criteria are not eligible for this study
On an effective combination cART regimen, generally a -drug regimen based on Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) treatment guidelines\r\n* Patients must be on cART >=  weeks; and\r\n* Evidence of viral suppression defined as HIV viral load <  copies/mL; and \r\n* No symptomatic AEs > grade  by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria probably or definitely attributed to cART; and\r\n* No laboratory AEs noted on protocol defined screening laboratories > grade  by CTCAE criteria probably or definitely attributed to cART, with exceptions noted below\r\n* Note: if cART is modified during the screening period, patients must be on an effective new regimen for >=  weeks and otherwise meet eligibility criteria\r\n* Most patients have viral loads that are suppressible to <  copies/mL, but about % of patients will occasionally have blips up to  copies/mL, which do not appear to correlate with lack of viral suppression in most studies; thus, an HIV viral load of =<  copies/mL for an occasional blip will be allowed, if there is documentation of an HIV viral load <  on the same regimen and no significant treatment interruption
