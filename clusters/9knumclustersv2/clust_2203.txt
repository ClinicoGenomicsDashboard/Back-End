Refractory disease: persistent sites of disease after achieving a best overall response of no response to front line therapy after a minimum of  cycles of induction therapy AND patient has never had recurrent/progressive disease. Persistent disease: persistent sites of disease after achieving a best overall response of partial response to frontline therapy after a minimum of  cycles of induction therapy AND patient has never had recurrent/progressive disease.
