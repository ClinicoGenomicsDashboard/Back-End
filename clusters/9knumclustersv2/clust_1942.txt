Females of child-bearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or has not been naturally post-menopausal for at least  consecutive months) must:\r\n* Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test obtained within  hours prior to starting the investigational drug\r\n* Not be breastfeeding\r\n* Agree to use, and be able to comply with, highly effective contraception (failure rate less than % per year) without interruption while on study treatment plus  half-lives of nivolumab (half-life up to  days) plus  days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of  weeks post treatment completion; complete abstinence is acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; period abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception; examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < % per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established and proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices; alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods from the options of diaphragm, cervical cap, vaginal sponge, and condom, or progesterone-only oral hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of < % per year; barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide
For women who are not postmenopausal (>=  months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent or use single or combined contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < % per year during the treatment period and for at least  months after the last dose of study drug; abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception; examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < % per year include tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices
For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of < % per year during the treatment period and for at least  days after the last dose of study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (>=  continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < % per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
