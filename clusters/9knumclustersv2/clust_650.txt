Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as -hydroxy--methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG CoA) inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil, and that cannot be discontinued at least  weeks prior to starting sonidegib study treatment; if it is essential that the patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be used with extra caution
