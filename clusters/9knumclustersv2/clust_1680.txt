Platelets >= ,/mcL (not requiring platelet transfusions)
Platelets < , cell/mm^ ( x ^/L). Qualifying laboratory value must occur at most recent measurement before enrollment and must be no more than  days before enrollment. No transfusions are allowed within  hours prior to study drug administration
Platelets >= ,/mm^ for MCL cohort and platelets >= ,/mm^ for DLBCL cohort, performed within  days prior to day  of protocol therapy\r\n* NOTE: platelet transfusions and packed red blood cell transfusion can be given prior to enrollment to achieve a target platelet (Plt) >= ,/uL for MCL and >= ,/uL for DLBCL and hemoglobin of >= . g/dL
Patients must be transfusion independent (i.e., no blood product transfusions for a period of at least  days prior to screening)
Platelets >= ,/mcL; >= ,/mcL if impairment is due to LPD/NHL (transfusions not permitted)

Platelets > ,/cu mm (transfusion allowed - however patients must not require more than two platelet transfusions per week)
Platelets >= , X ^ /L with transfusions allowed if stem cells available
Within  days prior to day  of protocol therapy unless otherwise stated: Platelets >= ,/mm^\r\n* NOTE: Platelet transfusions are not permitted within  days of platelet assessment unless cytopenia is secondary to disease involvement

Platelets: >= ,/mm^ (transfusion independent defined as not receiving platelet transfusions within  days prior to registration)
Platelets >=  K/uL (transfusions are permissible)
