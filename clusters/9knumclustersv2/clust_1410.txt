Known history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of AML, ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), or blast-phase CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia)
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML):
Patients with mature B-cell ALL or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are in first or second complete remission
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Patients with a myeloid hematologic malignancy (acute myelogenous leukemia, secondary myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome) unlikely to be cure by standard chemotherapy; this includes patients who have relapsed after standard chemotherapy treatments and patients in first remission with unfavorable prognostics features
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients who have failed or are intolerant of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or patients with other myeloproliferative diseases who are high risk and the intent of therapy is cure
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic or accelerated phase; prior therapies allowed
Chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Patients must not have blastic transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia
Relapse after previous allogeneic stem cell transplant for one of the following hematologic malignancies - acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), lymphoma, myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia meeting the following:\r\n* For non-chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), relapse will be defined based on disease specific morphologic criteria from a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific cytogenetics; relapse can be determined morphologically; equivocal results for relapse should result in a repeated test after an appropriate time interval (suggested  month) to determine eligibility\r\n* For CML, relapse will be defined as any cytogenetic evidence of a Philadelphia chromosome or persistence of breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/c-abl oncogene , non-receptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) rearrangements by molecular testing on at least two measurements over a  month interval; if cytogenetics are normal and there is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of a BCR/ABL fusion, patients will be eligible if they have evidence of a quantitative increase in CML measured either by quantitative PCR or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\r\n* For chronic phase CML patients only:\r\n** Must have failed (no response in  months or incomplete response at  months) or refused treatment with a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)\r\n** Must have failed (defined as incomplete response or relapse) or refused donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)
Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with relapsed or refractory disease who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation or other standard therapies
Current acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia
Myeloproliferative disorders to be included:\r\n* Idiopathic myelofibrosis\r\n* Polycythemia vera\r\n* Essential thrombocythemia\r\n* Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia\r\n* Chronic neutrophilic leukemia\r\n* Chronic eosinophilic leukemia\r\n* Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\r\n* Hypereosinophilic syndrome\r\n* Systemic mastocytosis
For patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, patients disease must have evidence of never responded to or progressed after receiving a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (e.g. imatinib mesylate)
Lymphoblastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) All subjects with evidence of CNS leukemia must be treated and be in CNS CR to be eligible for trial.
Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in myeloid blasts crisis
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in st or subsequent remission
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Subjects with any of the following will NOT be eligible for study:\r\n* Bone marrow involvement\r\n* Active myelogenous leukemia, or history of myelogenous leukemia\r\n* Pregnancy
Be diagnosed with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Chronic Myelogenous leukemia
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
