Evidence of a response (Partial response [PR] or better based on investigator's determination of response by international myeloma working group [IMWG] criteria) to at least  prior treatment regimen
Complete or partial response by International Working Group (IWG) Working Group or International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (ICML) criteria to maximum of one salvage line of chemotherapy without pre-HDT/ASCT salvage radiotherapy
Subjects must have failed hypomethylating treatment where \failure\ is defined as: Progression (according to  International Working Group [IWG] criteria) at any time after initiation of the hypomethylating treatment OR Failure to achieve complete or partial response or hematological improvement (HI) (according to  IWG) after at least  cycles treatment OR Relapse after initial complete or partial response or HI (according to  IWG criteria).
Patients must have either:\r\n* Symptomatic multiple myeloma who have responded to prior induction or salvage chemotherapy (i.e. chemosensitive disease): patients who are receiving high-dose melphalan and AHCT as part of their initial therapy require at least a partial response (PR) as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria for MM; patients who are receiving high-dose melphalan and AHCT as part of salvage therapy require at least a minor response to their last line of therapy to document chemosensitive disease; there is no limit on the number of prior regimens received by the patient; OR\r\n* Light chain (AL) amyloidosis who may be newly diagnosed or previously treated
Subjects with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria who are receiving or have completed induction chemotherapy, who have achieved at least a partial response (PR) on most recent therapy by IMWG criteria, and are eligible for auto-SCT for consolidation; a specific induction regimen is not dictated for this protocol, however, the induction regimen must not have contained melphalan (L-PAM, Alkeran)

Patients must carry a diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma according to international myeloma working group criteria and have relapsed or refractory disease according to international uniform response criteria after at least two prior treatment regimens including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulator (IMiD)
Must have had documented evidence of progressive disease as defined based on Investigator's determination of response of International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria on or after their last regimen
