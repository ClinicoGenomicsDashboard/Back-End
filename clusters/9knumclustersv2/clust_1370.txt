Patients must have controlled blood pressure with a systolic blood pressure <  mmHg and diastolic <  mmHg (for patients with an elevated initial blood pressure (BP) reading [hypertensive range], a repeat measurement at least  minutes later should be performed, and the two readings should be averaged to obtain a BP reading); any hypertensive at-home blood pressure reading will be confirmed in clinic; patients on anti-hypertensive medications are eligible, if blood pressure is controlled; study drug dosing will be interrupted for any reading >= /

History of hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy
Patients who have persistently elevated systolic blood pressures (BPs) >=  or diastolic BPs >=  need to have their systolic or diastolic BP controlled with anti-hypertensive agents for at least  days prior to the initiation of cell therapy; patients already on anti-hypertensive agents will have their medicine adjusted based on the clinical judgment of the patient care team
