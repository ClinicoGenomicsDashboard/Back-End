Cohort : Patients with recurrent WHO grade  glioma may have received prior external beam radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy; patients with stable WHO grade  glioma must have had prior chemotherapy (at least one cycle of temozolomide or procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine [PCV]-based chemotherapy); with regard to the prior therapy in Cohort , patients may have had treatment for no more than  prior relapses; relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that was used as initial therapy) or observation of stable disease; the intent therefore is that patients may have had  prior therapies (initial therapy and treatment for  relapses); if the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease, and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to  weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as  relapse\r\n* In Cohort  with recurrence, tumor recurrence is defined by the increase of maximum tumor diameter, based on the axial and/or coronal T or FLAIR MR images; increase of tumor size can be based on comparison with previous scans performed up to prior  years to allow assessment of slow-growth of the tumor\r\n* In Cohort , patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy:  weeks from any investigational agent,  weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least two weeks from vincristine,  weeks from nitrosoureas,  weeks from procarbazine administration, and  week for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count); any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Principal Investigator; with regard to previous RT, there must be at least  months from the completion of RT (or radiosurgery)
