NOTE: Subjects with a history of a DVT or pulmonary embolism > months prior to study enrollment who are on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin are eligible for this study.

Patients must have no medical contra-indications to, and be willing to take, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as all patients registering to the lenalidomide/rituximab Arms G and H will be required to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis; patients randomized to Arms G or H who have a history of a thrombotic vascular event will be required to have full anticoagulation, therapeutic doses of low-molecular weight heparin or warfarin to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR) between .-., or any other accepted full anticoagulation regimen (e.g., direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors) with appropriate monitoring for that agent; patients on Arms G and H without a history of a thromboembolic event are required to take a daily aspirin ( mg or  mg) for DVT prophylaxis; patients who are unable to tolerate aspirin should receive low molecular weight heparin therapy or warfarin treatment or another accepted full anticoagulation regimen
