Lesion that is technically feasible to irradiation and accessible for direct intratumoral injection
Patients must have at least one site of disease that is accessible for intratumoral injection of SD- (diameter >=  mm), percutaneously
The tumor must be accessible for injection
Subjects must have at least one site of disease that is accessible for intratumoral injection of SD- (diameter >=  mm), percutaneously
Low tumor burden with at least one lesion that is suitable for image-guided intratumoral injection and needle biopsy.
Lesions that are accessible for injection and electroporation, defined as cutaneous or subcutaneous disease.
Patients must have at least one site of disease that is accessible for intratumoral injection percutaneously (e.g. inguinal, axillary, cervical, or subcutaneous)
* one lesion must be ? mm and < mm in longest diameter, accessible for repeated intratumoral (IT) injection and accessible for baseline and on-treatment biopsies.
Tumor mass(es) accessible for intratumoral injection and are being considered for local radiation therapy and at least one additional site of disease outside the radiation field for assessment of distal (abscopal) response
At least one measurable tumor accessible for intratumoral injection and EP on investigators assessment
a) Dose Evaluation Portion: Patients should have at least one lesion accessible for intratumoral injection and biopsy. b) Melanoma Expansion Cohort: Patients must have at least one target lesion by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST v.), with at least one lesion accessible for intratumoral injection. Tumor biopsies are not required in the expansion cohort.
Patients must have at least one tumor accessible for intratumoral injection and EP on investigator's assessment.
Patients must have at least one site of disease that is accessible for intratumoral injection of SD- and of ipilimumab (diameter >= mm), percutaneously
for intratumoral cohorts, injection of tumor would require violation of ventricular system
