Participant with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to;\r\n* Ongoing or active infection, \r\n* Symptomatic congestive heart failure, \r\n* Unstable angina pectoris, \r\n* Cardiac arrhythmia, \r\n* A persistent grade  hypertension (as defined as stage  hypertension with systolic blood pressure [BP] >=  mm Hg or diastolic BP >=  mm Hg and medical intervention indicated) based on the baseline and previous BP readings if available\r\n* Psychiatric illness/social situations that will limit compliance with study requirements
History of any of the following cardio-vascular condition:\r\n* Myocardial infarction (MI)\r\n* Unstable angina\r\n* Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\r\n* Coronary angioplasty or stenting\r\n* Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\r\n* History of symptomatic chronic congestive heart failure (CHF)\r\n* History of cerebrovascular accidents including transient ischemic attacks (TIA)\r\n* Corrected QT interval (QTc) >  msec\r\n* Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >  mm Hg or diastolic BP of >  mm Hg); if the screening BP is elevated, adjustments in anti-hypertensives are permitted and a re-screening will be permitted for BP assessment with three consecutive values obtained  minutes apart; the  values have to be below / mm Hg for eligibility and can only be obtained after  days of the last change in anti-hypertensive medication; use of clonidine is not permissible for adjusting the BP during this period
No evidence of uncontrolled hypertension as documented by  baseline blood pressure (BP) readings taken at least  hour apart; the baseline systolic BP readings must be =<  mm Hg, and the baseline diastolic BP readings must be =<  mm Hg; use of antihypertensive medications to control BP is allowed
Uncontrolled hypertension (above / mm Hg)
Absence of uncontrolled angina or hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) >  mm Hg systolic or >  mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within  days of the first dose of study treatment
Hypertension defined as blood pressure (BP) systolic >  or diastolic >  mm Hg (Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication prior to study entry is allowed provided that the average of  BP readings prior to study treatment is ?/ mm Hg.)
Sustained systolic blood pressure (BP) > mm Hg or < mm Hg, diastolic BP > mm Hg or < mm Hg
Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > mm hg or diastolic >  mg Hg), angina pectoris, cardiac dysrhythmia, or recent (within  weeks) intracranial hemorrhage.
Hypertension defined as sustained BP >  millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) systolic, or >  mm Hg diastolic within  days before the first dose of study treatment and/or receiving medication to treat hypertension
Pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension defined as > / mm Hg with medication
Uncontrolled chronic hypertension defined as systolic >  or diastolic >  despite optimal therapy (initiation or adjustment of blood pressure (BP) medication prior to study entry is allowed provided that the average of  BP readings at a visit prior to enrollment is < / mm Hg)
Uncontrolled hypertension as defined by SBP >  mm/Hg or DBP >  mm/Hg despite medical therapy.
No evidence of pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension as documented by  baseline blood pressure (BP) readings taken at least  hour apart; the baseline systolic BP readings must be =<  mm Hg, and the baseline diastolic BP readings must be =<  mm Hg
If patient will need ribavirin in their regimen then the following inclusion:\r\n* Hemoglobin (Hg) >  g/dL for male\r\n* Hg >  g/dL for female
Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic >  mm Hg or diastolic >  mm Hg
Uncontrolled chronic hypertension defined as systolic >  or diastolic >  despite optimal therapy (initiation or adjustment of BP medication prior to study entry is allowed provided that the average of  BP readings at a visit prior to enrollment is < / mm Hg)
Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic >  and/or diastolic >  mm Hg)
Uncontrolled chronic hypertension defined as systolic >  or diastolic >  despite optimal therapy (initiation or adjustment of BP medication prior to study entry is allowed provided that the average of  BP readings at a visit prior to enrollment is < / mm Hg)
Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic greater than  mm Hg or diastolic greater than  mm Hg despite antihypertensive medications.
Uncontrolled hypertension (mean systolic blood pressure [BP] >=  mm Hg and/or mean diastolic BP >=  mm Hg on  determinations  minutes apart while on  anti-hypertensive agents) or hypertension requiring treatment with more than  anti-hypertensive agents
Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) >  mm Hg systolic, or >  mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within  days of the first dose of study treatment
Poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. systolic >milimiter (mm) Mercury (Hg) or diastolic >mm Hg)
Sustained systolic blood pressure (BP) > mm Hg or < mm Hg, diastolic BP > mm Hg or < mm Hg
Baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) >  mm Hg; this is based on the average of two values-separate seated, resting measurements taken five minutes apart; blood pressure (BP) does not need to be checked in both arms unless a reading is below  mm Hg, in which case the other arm can be checked as well; if BP is checked in both arms, the higher value is deemed accurate for calculating the average
Patients cannot have baseline hypotension, defined as systolic BP lower than  mm Hg on two readings obtained on two separate days prior to study enrollment
Poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. systolic >  mm Hg or diastolic >  mm Hg)
Has NYHA Class III or IV heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension (SBP ? mm Hg; DBP ? mm Hg).
The subject has uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) >  mm Hg systolic, or >  mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment (BP must be controlled at screening)
