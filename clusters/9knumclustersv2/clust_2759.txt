CNS leukemia
Patients with known active CNS leukemia.
COHORT : Has known active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia; subjects with previously treated CNS leukemia may participate provided that they have documented clearance of CNS leukemia and are not actively treated with intrathecal chemotherapy
COHORT : Has known active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia; subjects with previously treated CNS leukemia may participate provided that they have documented clearance of CNS leukemia and are not actively treated with intrathecal chemotherapy
Presence of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. Subjects adequately treated for CNS leukemia documented by  consecutive cerebrospinal fluid samples negative for leukemia cells are eligible. Subjects with no history of CNS leukemia will not be required to undergo cerebrospinal fluid sampling for eligibility.
Patients with symptomatic CNS leukemia or patients with poorly controlled CNS leukemia
Patients with symptomatic CNS leukemia or patients with poorly controlled CNS leukemia.
Clinical symptoms suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or known CNS leukemia. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during screening is required only if there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening.
Concurrent therapy for extramedullary leukemia or central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma: Concurrent therapy or prophylaxis for testicular leukemia, CNS leukemia, and CNS lymphoma including standard intrathecal chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy will be allowed as clinically indicated. Such treatment may continue until the planned course is completed. Subjects must be in CNS remission at the time of protocol enrollment if there is a history of CNS involvement. Maintenance therapy after transplant is allowed
Patients with symptomatic CNS leukemia or patients with poorly controlled CNS leukemia
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia and/or leukemic meningitis; subjects with previously treated CNS leukemia may participate provided they are stable (e.g., without evidence of active disease by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline) and have no evidence of leukemic blasts on analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of initiation of selinexor and sorafenib administration will be at least  weeks for cytotoxic agents or at least  half-lives for cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agents; the use of chemotherapeutic or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study with the following exceptions: () intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at the discretion of the PI and with the agreement of the sponsor; controlled CNS leukemia is defined by the absence of active clinical signs of CNS disease and no evidence of CNS leukemia on the most recent  simultaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluations; () use of one dose of cytarabine (up to  g/m^) or hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy; these medications will be recorded in the case-report form
Individuals with CNS  leukemia
Known active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, as defined by unequivocal morphologic evidence of lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), use of CNS-directed local treatment for active disease within the prior  days, symptomatic CNS leukemia (i.e., cranial nerve palsies or other significant neurologic dysfunction) within  days; patients may have history of CNS leukemic involvement if definitively treated with prior therapy and no evidence of active disease (defined as >=  consecutive spinal fluid assessments with no evidence of disease) at the time of registration; prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy is not a criterion for exclusion
Patients with symptomatic CNS leukemia or patients with poorly controlled CNS leukemia
Concurrent therapy for extramedullary leukemia or central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma: concurrent therapy or prophylaxis for testicular leukemia, CNS leukemia, and CNS lymphoma including standard intrathecal chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy will be allowed as clinically indicated; such treatment may continue until the planned course is completed; subjects must be in CNS remission at the time of protocol enrollment if there is a history of CNS involvement
Research participants with CNS involvement by leukemia, if deemed to be controlled and treatable by study team, at the time of enrollment are eligible; however, the CNS disease has to have been adequately treated with complete resolution of CNS leukemia confirmed by cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis and imaging studies (if applicable) to be eligible to proceed with lymphodepletion
If prior CNS leukemia, it must be treated and in CNS complete remission (CR)
Patients with active known CNS lymphoma. Patients with history of CNS leukemia now in remission are eligible for the trial.
Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, as defined by unequivocal morphologic evidence of lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or symptomatic CNS leukemia (i.e. cranial nerve palsies or other significant neurologic dysfunction) within  days of treatment; prophylactic intrathecal medication is not a reason for exclusion
All patients with evidence of CNS leukemia must be treated and be in CNS CR to be eligible for study
Patients must be free of active or ongoing ischemic or degenerative CNS disease and no active or resistant CNS leukemia
CNS or testicular leukemia at diagnosis allowed
CNS leukemia
Patients must have the status of CNS or CNS only, and no clinical signs or neurologic symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial palsy
Subjects with clinical symptoms suggesting active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or known CNS leukemia. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening.
Known active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, defined as morphologic evidence of leukemic blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), use of CNS directed intrathecal treatment for active disease within  days prior to Screening, or symptomatic CNS leukemia (i.e., cranial nerve palsies or other significant neurologic dysfunction) within  days prior to Screening.
Known CNS lymphoma or leukemia.
Known CNS lymphoma or leukemia.
Active CNS leukemia
The patient has known active or suspected CNS leukemia. If suspected, CNS leukemia should be ruled out with relevant imaging and/or examination of cerebrospinal fluid.
EXCLUSION FOR TREATMENT: Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, as defined by unequivocal morphologic evidence of lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or symptomatic CNS leukemia (i.e. cranial nerve palsies or other significant neurologic dysfunction) within  days of treatment; prophylactic intrathecal medication is not a reason for exclusion\r\n* If the lumbar puncture (LP) is traumatic (containing red blood cells [RBCs]) and cannot be repeated the Steinherz/Bleyer ratio will be used to determined unequivocal evidence of CSF leukemia at the discretion of the treating physician
Patients with symptomatic CNS leukemia or patients with poorly controlled CNS leukemia
Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia within two weeks of registration; patients with a history of CNS leukemia must have adequate treatment as defined by at least two negative spinal fluid assessments separated by at least one week; patients who have received cranial radiation therapy (XRT) must still be eligible to receive total body irradiation to  Gy
Absence of CNS involvement by leukemia.
Clinical evidence of active CNS leukemia
Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, as defined by unequivocal morphologic evidence of lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or symptomatic CNS leukemia (i.e. cranial nerve palsies or other significant neurologic dysfunction) within  days of enrollment; prophylactic intrathecal medication is not a reason for exclusion
Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, as defined by unequivocal morphologic evidence of lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), use of CNS-directed local treatment for active disease within the prior  days, symptomatic CNS leukemia (i.e., cranial nerve palsies or other significant neurologic dysfunction) within  days; prophylactic intrathecal medication is not a reason for exclusion

Patients must have the status of central nervous system (CNS) or CNS only, and no clinical signs or neurologic symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial palsy
History of known CNS leukemia, including cerebrospinal fluid positive for AML blasts; lumbar puncture is recommended for subjects with symptoms of CNS leukemia to rule out extramedullary CNS involvement;
CNS leukemia
Subjects with clinical symptoms suggesting active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or known CNS leukemia. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if there is clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening.
