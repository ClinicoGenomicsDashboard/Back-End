Primary immunodeficiency disorder or other nonmalignant inherited disease (except Fanconi anemia) treatable by allogeneic HCT
Fanconi anemia
Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. At minimum, the diagnosis of Fanconi anemia must be excluded by diepoxybutane (DEB) or equivalent testing on peripheral blood or marrow.
Patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia; (patients with aplastic anemia associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH] or inherited marrow failure syndromes, except Fanconi anemia, will be allowed)
Bone marrow failure syndromes, except for Fanconi anemia
Patients with Fanconi anemia; at a minimum, the diagnosis of Fanconi anemia must be excluded by diepoxybutane (DEB) or equivalent testing on peripheral blood or marrow in patients younger than  years of age; (additional mutational testing may have been performed in a clinical or research capacity on a per patient basis but is not considered an exclusion criteria)
Acquired bone marrow failure syndromes, except for Fanconi anemia
Fanconi Anemia or other underlying bone marrow failure syndrome
Diagnosis of Fanconi anemia must be excluded by mitomycin C or diepoxybutane chromosomal breakage testing on peripheral blood at a CLIA-approved laboratory (not required for patients with a genetic mutation consistent with DC)
Diagnosis of Fanconi anemia
Patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) must have aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome without excess blasts, or high risk genotype as defined below\r\n* Aplastic anemia is defined as having at least one of the following when not receiving growth factors or transfusions:\r\n** Platelet count <  x ^ IL\r\n** Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <  x ^/L\r\n** Hemoglobin (Hgb) <  g/dL\r\n* Myelodysplastic syndrome with multilineage dysplasia with or without chromosomal anomalies\r\n* High risk genotype (e.g. IVS- or exon  FANCC mutations, or BRCA or  mutations)
Bone marrow failure syndromes, except for Fanconi anemia
Acquired bone marrow failure syndromes except for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita
Diamond Blackfan anemia;
Fanconi anemia (FA)
Patients with Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome, Shwachman syndrome, or other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are not eligible
Fanconi anemia
Primary immunodeficiency disorder or other nonmalignant inherited disease (except aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia) treatable by allogeneic HCT
Patients with Aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia
Non-malignant disorders deemed curable by allogeneic transplantation: a. primary immune deficiencies, b. severe aplastic anemia not responding to immune suppressive therapy, c. osteopetrosis d. selected cases of erythroid disorders such as ? ? thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, Diamond-Blackfan anemia. e. congenital/hereditary cytopenia, including Fanconi Anemia before any clonal malignant evolution (MDS, AML). Note: Subjects will be eligible if they meet either item  OR item .
Is undergoing transplant for the treatment of nonmalignant hematological disorders (for example: aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, Fanconi anemia).
Fanconi Anemia
Patients with Fanconi anemia or other cancer-predisposition syndromes
Patients with history of Down's syndrome, Fanconi anemia or other known marrow failure condition
Fanconi anemia (FA)
Patients with Down syndrome and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragility syndromes (such as Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome) are excluded
Anemia below lower limit of normal or anemia requiring transfusion support as per center standard
Anemia
Diagnosis of Fanconi anemia must be excluded in patients younger than  years of age by diepoxybutane testing on peripheral blood or comparable testing on marrow.
Other indications for HCT, including Fanconi anemia, other form of inherited bone marrow failure diseases, metabolic disorder, hemoglobinopathy, or immune deficiency
Have hypothyroidism and anemia
Patient with aplastic anemia will be excluded
Persons with any other condition (such as lichen planus, Fanconi anemia, heavy tobacco use, etc) making them at higher risk for oral cancer development
Subjects at increased risk for radiation toxicities, such as known collagen vascular disease (example, scleroderma, Sjogren's disease, etc) or other inherited radiation hypersensitivity syndromes (example, Gorlin syndrome, Fanconi anemia, ataxia-telangiectasia, etc.)
