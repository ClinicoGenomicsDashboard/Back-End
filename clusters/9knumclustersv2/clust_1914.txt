Patients who have received >=  days of prior ibrutinib or any prior treatment with another Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor are not eligible
Prior therapy must include a BTK inhibitor in diseases for which approved therapy includes a BTK inhibitor (i.e., SLL/CLL, WM, and mantle cell lymphoma). Subjects with DLBCL must have failed, refused, or be ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. Subjects with low grade lymphoma must be progressing and requiring treatment.
Subjects who were intolerant to a BTK inhibitor
Prior exposure to a BTK or BCL- inhibitor
Previous therapy with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition
No history of prior BTK-inhibitor-containing therapy.
Prior therapy with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors
Has previously received a btk inhibitor and had progressive disease during therapy; patients who have previously discontinued btk inhibitor therapy because of intolerance may be considered for eligibility per the assessment of the PI and treating physician if there is reason that the patient may better tolerate btk inhibitor therapy at enrollment versus previously
Has progressed on prior therapy with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors
Prior BTK inhibitor treatment.
Prior exposure to ibrutinib or to a BCR inhibitor (eg Btk or PI kinase or Syk inhibitors) or a BCL- inhibitor (eg venetoclax)
Prior exposure to a Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine-protein kinase (BTK) inhibitor
Patients who have been previously treated with ibrutinib (or any Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor) are eligible for the ibrutinib pre-treated cohort as long as prior ibrutinib or BTK inhibitor therapy was not discontinued due to toxicity/adverse event; there is no minimum dose of ibrutinib; any prior administration will disqualify patients for the ibrutinib-nave cohort and will require enrollment on the ibrutinib pre-treated cohort
Previous treatment with another Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) -inhibitor.
Prior exposure to a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor
Arm B only: ibrutinib or other Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor;
Patients who have previously received ibrutinib or another inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
Prior exposure to a BTK inhibitor
Prior use of ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors, rituximab or lenalidomide
Known cysteine- Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) mutation or CLL refractory to or progressed during ibrutinib or other cysteine (Cys)- binding BTK inhibitor treatment
Previous therapy with ibrutinib, or any drug that specifically inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
Prior exposure to ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors.
No prior chemotherapy, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy, or monoclonal anti-body therapy for treatment of CLL or SLL
Relapsed after, or refractory to, prior BTK inhibitor therapy.
Previous treatment with a PIK inhibitor or BTK inhibitor
have BTK or PLCgamma mutations per local laboratory assessment, with or without progression on ibrutinib
Prior therapy with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor
Previous treatment with a PIK inhibitor or BTK inhibitor.
Has diagnosis and prior treatment for each non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype as defined below: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL): pathologically verified diagnosis of MCL based on local pathology report, relapsed or refractory disease after at least  prior lines of therapy, including at least  cycle of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy and documented progressive disease (PD) during or after BTK inhibitor treatment or participants who could not tolerate BTK inhibitor [ie, discontinued BTK inhibitor due to adverse events (AEs)], b) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL): pathologically confirmed diagnosis of non-transformed DLBCL, and relapsed or refractory disease; for those participants who have not received HDT/ASCT are not eligible for HDT/ASCT due to comorbidities, c) Follicular lymphoma (FL): pathologically confirmed diagnosis of FL of Grade , , or a according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria without pathological evidence of transformation, and relapsed disease after at least two prior systemic therapies including one anti-CD containing combination regimen
Prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor.
Must have relapsed/refractory disease after receiving  or more lines of therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (eg ibrutinib) if approved by the local health authority and commercially accessible. All Arms:
Prior treatment with a PIK inhibitor or BTK inhibitor
Subject must have received at least one BCR PI (ibrutinib, idelalisib, or other approved BTK or PIK inhibitor) and/or venetoclax;
Has, at the initiation of study drug, received cytotoxic chemotherapy or a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)-inhibitor (e.g. ibrutinib) within the past  weeks or rituximab within the past  months
Prior exposure to bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor
Prior treatment with a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor
Concurrent enrollment in another therapeutic investigational study or prior therapy with ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors
Discontinuation on prior BTK inhibitor or PIK delta inhibitor due to adverse events within prior  months
