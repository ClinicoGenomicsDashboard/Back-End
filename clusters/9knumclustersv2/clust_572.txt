Patients who have had chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiotherapy, and have not recovered from acute toxicity to their pretreatment baseline or to a grade  level within  weeks ( weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study \r\n* Note: patients with chronic residual prior therapy-related toxicity (e.g. vitiligo, alopecia, low grade neuropathy), or in the consensus opinion of the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN)/Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) investigators would not impact the safety of the patient or the integrity of the study, are not excluded\r\n* Note: for resolution of autoimmune toxicity from prior immune therapy, patients must be off steroids for at least  days without relapse of autoimmune toxicity, or it must be at least  days from their last dose of infliximab or related immunosuppressive therapy without relapse of autoimmune toxicity
Patients must have recovered from any VEGF blocking drug-related toxicity (proteinuria, hypertension, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatic toxicity)
Subjects who have not recovered to within one grade level (not to exceed grade ) of their baseline following a significant adverse event or toxicity attributed to prior anti-cancer treatment are excluded
Have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy.
Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity associated with prior therapy by the start of study treatment
Patients should have discontinued any and all other therapy for CLL >=  hours prior to start of study therapy and recovered from any toxicity due to these therapies to grade =< 
Recovery from acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery and radiation, or no toxicity >= grade 
Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery; toxicity should be =< grade 
Participants must have recovered to grade  toxicity from prior therapy

Patients must have recovered to =< grade  in terms of toxicity from prior treatments (excluding neuropathy which can be =< grade )
Received any anti-cancer or investigational therapy within  days prior to the first dose of study drug or has not recovered to less than Grade  clinically significant adverse effect(s)/toxicity(ies) of any previous therapy
Patients must have recovered from acute toxicity (to grade  or less) of all previous therapy prior to enrollment. Treatment may start earlier if necessitated by the patient's medical condition (e.g. progressive disease) following discussion with the Investigator.
Recovery from acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery and radiation, or no toxicity >= grade 
Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery; toxicity should be =< grade  or returned to baseline
Prior hormonal/endocrine therapy =<  weeks prior to study entry (except for letrozole, which does not need to be interrupted); patients must have recovered from toxicity > grade , except for alopecia
Prior HER-targeted therapy <  weeks prior to study entry; patients must have recovered from toxicity > grade , except for alopecia
Grade >  treatment-related toxicity from prior therapy
Must have recovered from acute toxicity from prior treatment
Patients must be at least  weeks from any prior treatments and have recovered (to < grade ) from acute toxicity attributed to this prior treatment
