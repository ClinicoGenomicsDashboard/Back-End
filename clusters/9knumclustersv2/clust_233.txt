Spot urine total protein:creatinine ratio >, mg/gm
Urine protein =< + or =<  mg/dL OR urine protein/creatinine ratio =< , performed within  days of treatment initiation
Urine/protein creatinine ratio spot-check < . mg/mg
Creatinine clearance >=  ml/min (estimated or measured creatinine clearance) or serum creatinine =< . mg/dl\r\n* Random urine protein <  mg/dL; if >=  mg/dL then a -hour urine protein collection will be performed to accurately demonstrate that the -hour total is <  mg, the level acceptable for enrollment on study
Significant proteinuria: urinary protein/creatinine ratio >. mg/mg in a non first void urine sample
Urine protein/creatinine <  mg/mg
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =<  mg/mg (. mg/mmol) creatinine or -hour (hr) urine protein of <  g
[urine protein]/[urine creatinine]: if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/dL
[(urine protein) x.]/[urine creatinine]: if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L
Spot urine Ca:Cr ratio >. (> mg/g creatinine)
