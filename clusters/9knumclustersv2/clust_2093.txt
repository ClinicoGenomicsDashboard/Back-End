Evidence of progressive disease by imaging modalities or biopsy - persistent positron emission tomography (PET) activity, though possibly related to lymphoma, is not an exclusion criterion in the absence of computed tomography (CT) changes indicating progression
Subject must have positron emission tomography (PET)-positive disease as per Lugano Classification
Bone lesions ( or more osteolytic lesions on low-dose whole body computed tomography [LDCT], positron-emission tomography with computed tomography [PET-CT] or CT)
N lymph nodes negative on positron emission tomography (PET) scan or mediastinoscopy
Participants must have no evidence of nodal involvement (N) or distant metastases (M) on staging studies, which may include positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and/or mediastinoscopy
Subject must have been referred for a clinically indicated PET-computed tomography (CT)
Patients who have a history of serious adverse events related to a previous MRI or PET/computed tomography (CT)
No clinical evidence of nodal disease (N-N) as assessed by CT and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT
Stage T-aN-, by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) th edition, based on the following minimum workup:\r\n* Computed tomography (CT) chest/abdomen with contrast \r\n* Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT of the whole-body or skull base to mid-thigh\r\n* Patients must have regional adenopathy and have undergone endoscopic biopsy with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-proven peri-esophageal nodal involvement
Patients that have early stage non-small cell lung cancer or clinical suspicion of the same in cases where the lesion is not amenable to biopsy but is enlarging and positron emission tomography (PET)-positive; all patients are to be treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy as a monotherapy
Negative pregnancy test within  days of baseline positron emission tomography (PET) scan for pre-menopausal patients
Radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy, defined as a lymph node greater than  cm in diameter on axial imaging (CT or MRI or positron emission tomography [PET]/CT)
