For patients who have undergone or will undergo open resection of recurrent or progressive tumor, residual disease following resection is not mandated for eligibility into the study; to best assess the extent of residual disease post-resection, a MRI scan should be done no later than  hours in the immediate post-resection period and within  days prior to registration; if the -hour scan is more than  days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated; if the steroid dose is increased more than % between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI is required on a stable or decreasing steroid dosage for at least  days
