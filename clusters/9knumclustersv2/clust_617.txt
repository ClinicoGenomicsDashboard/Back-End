Creatinine clearance >=  milliliter per minute per . square meter (mL/min/. m^) based either on Cockcroft-Gault estimate or based on a - or -hour urine collection.
Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to (>=)  milliliter per minute (mL/min) either as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation or based on urine collection ( or  hours).
Estimated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault >= milliliter per minute (mL/min) / . square meter (m^);
Creatinine clearance >= milliliter per minutes (mL/min).
Calculated creatinine clearance ?  milliliter per minute (mL/min).
Renal: creatinine clearance >= milliliter per minute (mL/min).
Renal: serum creatinine >= milliliter per minute (mL/min) either as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation or based on urine collection ( or  hours).
