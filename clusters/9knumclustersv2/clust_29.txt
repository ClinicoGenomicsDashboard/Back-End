Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for CLL or NHL, need additional treatment (or have need for cytoreduction as mentioned above), and meet criteria for relapsed or refractory disease; they may not be a candidate for curative therapy; relapsed disease is defined as a patient who previously achieved a complete remission (CR) or a partial remission (PR), but after a period of six or more months demonstrates evidence of disease progression; refractory disease is defined as progression within six months of the last anti-leukemic or anti-lymphoma therapy, or any response less than a CR or PR
During dose escalation, patients must have received at least one prior therapy, need additional cytoreduction, and meet criteria for relapsed or refractory disease; relapsed disease is defined as a patient who previously achieved a CR or a PR, but after a period of six or more months demonstrates evidence of disease progression; refractory disease is defined as progression within six months of the last anti-leukemic therapy, or any response less than a CR or PR; patients who are previously untreated, and do not wish to receive chemotherapy or immunotherapy, are eligible for the dose expansion portion of the study
