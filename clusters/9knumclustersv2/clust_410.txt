Pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) clinical Stage II, III, or IVA squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity (excluding lip). Subjects must be staged using AJCC Cancer Staging Manual Edition . (appendices  and ).
Patients must have histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma with measurable, stage III (lymph node or in transit lesions) or stage IVA, IVB, or IVC disease.
Suspected or histologically/cytologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of the oral cavity, stage III, IVA or IVB (according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] th edition); patients with a suspected lesion may be enrolled and a baseline biopsy will be obtained as part of the study; if squamous cell histology is not confirmed, patients will be discontinued from the study
Advanced stage NSCLC (stage IVa [malignant pleural effusion (is now staged as stage IVa by the most recent staging system), or stage IV, or recurrent disease])
Any patient eligible for internal implantation without MR guidance will be considered eligible for this protocol; standard criteria for internal implantation include:\r\n* Carcinoma of the cervix: stage I-IVA or vaginal recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the uterus: stage IIIB (vaginal involvement), inoperable, or vaginal recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the vagina: stage I-IVA or vaginal recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the vulva: stage I-IVA or recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the urethra/bladder
