Prior androgen deprivation (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist and/or non-steroidal anti-androgen) is allowed if discontinued at least  days prior to study enrollment and given for =<  days duration\r\n* For example: Patients on prior LHRH analogs (post-prostatectomy), the discontinuation date should be calculated based on the expected duration of the sustained release injection, not simply the injection date of the drug; for instance, if a . mg sustained release dose of leuprolide acetate is given ( month duration), then the expected duration of such a dose would be  days after the injection date; for a . mg leuprolide ( month duration), the discontinuation date would be  days after the injection date\r\n* Please note: Finasteride or dutasteride must be stopped before treatment but should not determine eligibility
