Uncontrolled systemic disease(s) such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus; blood pressure must be =< the th percentile for age, height, and gender
A blood pressure (BP) =< the th percentile for age, height, and gender for pediatric patients <  years old and =< / mmHg for patients >=  years old; patients should not be receiving medication for treatment of hypertension (except patients with Wilms tumor and RCC who may be eligible if on stable doses of no more than one anti-hypertensive medication with a baseline BP =< ULN for pediatric patients and =< / for adult patients); please note that  serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
A blood pressure (BP) =< % percentile for age, height, and gender; patients on stable doses of no more than one anti-hypertensive medication, with a baseline BP =< % percentile for age, height, and gender will be eligible
Adequate Blood Pressure Control defined as a blood pressure (BP) <= the th percentile for age, height, and gender measured, subjects on stable doses of no more than one anti-hypertensive medication, with a baseline BP <= th percentile for age, height and gender, will be eligible.
A blood pressure (BP) =< the th percentile for age, height, and gender, and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension; please note that  serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
Hypertension:\r\n* Patients, - years of age must have a blood pressure that is =< th percentile for age, height and gender at the time of registration\r\n** The normal blood pressure by height, age and gender tables can be accessed in the Generic Forms section of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) members webpage\r\n* Patients who are >=  years of age must have a blood pressure that is < / mm of Hg at the time of registration\r\n* Note: if a blood pressure (BP) reading prior to registration is above the th percentile for age, height and gender it must be rechecked and documented to be =< the th percentile for age, height and gender prior to patient registration
Blood pressure (BP) =< th percentile for age, height, and gender and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension
A blood pressure (BP) =< the th percentile for age, height and gender despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within  days of the first dose of the study treatment; please note that  serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure > th percentile for age, height and gender (systolic or diastolic) despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within  days of the first dose of study treatment
A blood pressure (BP) =< the th percentile for age, height, and gender and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension
A blood pressure (BP) =< the th percentile for age, height, and gender measured within  days prior to enrollment; please note that  serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP; patients with hypertension controlled on antihypertensive medications will be allowed if otherwise eligible
A blood pressure (BP) =< the th percentile for age, height, and gender measured, and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension; please note that  serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
Hypertension must be well controlled (=< th percentile for age and height if patient is =<  years) on stable doses of medication
Patients - years of age must have a blood pressure that is ? th percentile for age, height and gender at the time of enrollment.
Note: If a BP reading prior to enrollment is above the th percentile for age, height and gender, it is to be rechecked and documented to be ? th percentile for age, height and gender prior to patient enrollment.
Patients with inadequately controlled systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] and/or\r\ndiastolic blood pressure [DBP] > th percentile for age and height)\r\n* Patients with a prior history of hypertensive crisis and/or hypertensive encephalopathy\r\nIf a blood pressure (BP) measurement prior to registration is > th percentile for age and height, it must be rechecked and documented to be < th percentile for age and height prior to registration; if a patient falls between the height or weight percentiles, site should average the value as appropriate; for patients >=  years, use adult normal ranges for blood pressure; patients with hypertension are eligible if their blood pressures become < th percentile after anti-hypertensive medications
Participants should have normal blood pressure according to age; participants  years of age and younger should have a blood pressure =< th percentile for age, height and gender, and should not be receiving medication for treatment of hypertension; preexisting hypertension in adults should be controlled (either with pharmacological or non-pharmacological methods) at the time of enrollment
BMI ? th percentile or waist circumference ? th percentile for age and gender
Patient must have blood pressure ? th percentile for age, height, and gender
Adequate Blood Pressure Control defined as: Blood pressure <= the th percentile for age, height, and gender.
Adequate blood pressure defined as:\r\n* A blood pressure (BP) =< the th percentile for age, height, and gender measured; adequate blood pressure can be achieved using medication for treatment of hypertension
BMI >= th percentile at time of study enrollment
Hypertensive patients are eligible provided the hypertension is well controlled (th percentile for age and height if patient =<  years) on stable doses of medication
