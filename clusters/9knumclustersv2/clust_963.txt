Prior prostatectomy
Prior local therapy with prostatectomy required, with available tissue from prostatectomy specimen to send for genomic and transcriptomic testing; specifically, either formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks or - unstained slides from the primary prostatectomy specimen will need to be available for central pathologic review and processing
No prior prostatectomy or prostatic radiation
Prior prostatectomy

Previous prostate cancer surgery to include: prostatectomy, hyperthermia and cryosurgery
No prior prostatectomy or cryotherapy of the prostate
Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to radical prostatectomy is allowed, and post-prostatectomy hormonal therapy is allowed only if the onset of androgen ablation is =<  days prior to the date of registration
Presence of multiple small bowel loops trapped within the immediate tumor bed (post hysterectomy or prostatectomy)
Androgen deprivation therapy started prior to prostatectomy for >  months ( days) duration; \r\n* Note: The use of finasteride or dutasteride ( tamsulosin) for longer periods prior to prostatectomy is acceptable
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before or after prostatectomy
Histologically confirmed recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate =<  year prior to registration and >=  months following localized treatment of: \r\n* EBRT or\r\n* Permanent prostate brachytherapy or\r\n* High dose rate brachytherapy or\r\n* Any combination of the above radiotherapy treatments or\r\n* Prostatectomy; patients who have a localized recurrence following prostatectomy with a discernible mass identifiable on trans-rectal ultrasound that can be readily accessed as judged by the treating urologist or radiation oncologist
History of salvage prostatectomy
Patients must have undergone local treatment via prostatectomy or radiation therapy
Prior prostatectomy
History of diagnosis of prostate cancer after undergoing prostatectomy
Scheduled to undergo a prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins
Subjects must be able to safely be on lithium carbonate treatment for a period of at least four weeks prior to the scheduled prostatectomy
The study population will consist of patients who have undergone primary therapy (prostatectomy or primary radiation) for biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate and now have biochemical-only recurrence
Completion of appropriate prior treatment with local therapy (i.e., prostatectomy, radiation therapy or equivalent), per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines
Patients having robotic prostatectomy.
Prostatectomy with or without radiation for the pilot study patients only
