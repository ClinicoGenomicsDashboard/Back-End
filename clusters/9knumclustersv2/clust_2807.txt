Patients must have baseline troponin test performed for eligibility; however, no associated values must be met in order for the patient to be eligible
Baseline (pre-treatment) serum troponin T (TnT) >= . ng/mL; Troponin T levels may be rechecked and therapy given if levels decrease to < . ng/mL
Troponin-T value > . ng/mL or B-type natriuretic protein (BNP) >  pg/mL by central laboratory assessment Subjects with baseline troponin-T > ULN or BNP >  pg/mL are eligible but must have a cardiologist evaluation prior to enrollment in the trial for baseline assessment and optimization of cardioprotective therapy.
Elevated Troponin  levels at screening or known to have persistently elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).

Troponin-I =< ULN
Cardiac troponin value above the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN);
serum troponin T levels within normal limits;
Patients with baseline troponin levels greater than the institutional limit of normal
creatinine kinase - MB, troponin-I, and troponin-T within normal limits
Troponin blood level within normal limits.
Patients with a history of cardiac disease are excluded: myocardial infarction or arterial thromboembolic events within  months prior to baseline, severe or unstable angina, New York Heart Association Class III or IV disease, QTCB (corrected according to Bazett's formula) interval >  msec, serious uncontrolled hypertension (systolic >  and/or diastolic >  mm Hg); baseline electrocardiography, echocardiography and assessment of serum troponin (I) are included in the screening exams; subjects in whom these assays are abnormal (electrocardiogram [EKG] excluding st degree branch block, sinus brachycardia, sinus tachycardia or non-specific T wave changes, serum troponin >= grade ) are ineligible
Patients must have albumin, urinalysis, and Troponin I obtained within  days prior to sub-study registration
Patients must have albumin, urinalysis, and Troponin I obtained within  days prior to substudy registration
Patients with a history of cardiac disease are excluded; baseline electrocardiography and assessment of serum troponin (I) are included the screening exams; subjects in whom these assays are abnormal (electrocardiogram [EKG] excluding st degree bundle branch block, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia or non-specific T wave changes, serum troponin >= grade )
Cardiac Troponin I within normal limit.
Serum cardiac troponin (cTn) level ? % percentile of the upper reference limit
Troponin-T value > . ng/ml or BNP > pg/mL.  Subjects with baseline troponin-T >Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) > pg/mL are eligible but must have cardiologist evaluation prior to enrollment in the trial for baseline assessment and optimization of cardioprotective therapy.
B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) above  times the baseline value and above the ULN that is sustained consecutive, scheduled blood draws. Troponin I above ULN, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) above ULN or Cystatin above ULN.
Cardiac troponin I or cardiac troponin T levels above the limit of normal as specified by the manufacturer.
Patients with baseline troponin levels greater than the institutional limit of normal
Patients with elevated troponin T and/or CK levels (> . x ULN for the laboratory) or with history of myositis, rhabdomyolysis or other myopathic disease.
Recent exposure to cardiotoxic agents (including anthracyclines) within  months of enrollment. Subjects with troponin-I and BNP levels above ULN are excluded.
Patients with N-terminal (NT)-proB-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) >=  ng/L or BNP >=  ng/L, abnormal troponin T, cardiac muscle (cTnT) or troponin I, cardiac muscle (cTnI) can only be included after evaluation by cardiology to determine of the risk associate with the treatment; this evaluation needs to be discussed with the principal investigator (PI)
Troponin T or I within normal institutional limits
Troponin I or T within normal limits
Troponin-T value >. ng/mL or BNP > pg/mL. Subjects with baseline troponin-T >ULN or BNP > pg/mL are eligible but must have cardiologist evaluation prior to enrollment in the trial for baseline assessment and optimization of cardioprotective therapy.
