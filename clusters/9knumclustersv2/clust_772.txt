Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential: negative serum pregnancy test within  days of study treatment and confirmed prior to treatment on day .\r\n* Postmenopausal is defined as any one or more of the following:\r\n** Age >=  years.\r\n** Age <  and amenorrheic for  year or more in the absence of chemotherapy and/or hormonal treatment.\r\n** Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post menopausal range for women under .\r\n** Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses >  year ago.\r\n** Chemotherapy-induced menopause with >  year interval since last menses.\r\n** Surgical sterilisation (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal patients; women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for  months without an alternative medical cause; the following age-specific requirements apply:\r\n* Women <  years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for  months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)\r\n* Women >=  years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for  months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >  year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >  year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy)\r\n* A positive serum pregnancy test must be confirmed by a pelvic ultrasound (US) since some non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) may secrete beta-hCG and cause a false positive pregnancy; a pelvic US does not need to be repeated with each cycle unless the treating physician thinks it is necessary to do so
Women of non-child bearing potential must be:\r\n* Women more than  years must be post-menopausal for at least  months following the end of all exogenous hormonal treatments OR\r\n* Women under  years must be postmenopausal for at least  months following the end of exogenous hormonal treatments and with LH and FSH levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution OR\r\n* Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation
