Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), Salmon-Durie stage II or III, or International Staging System II or III or fulfill the calcium, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions (CRAB) criteria; patients should not have previously been treated; finally, patients must meet at least one of the following parameters of measurable disease:\r\n* Bone marrow plasmacytosis with > % plasma cells, or sheets of plasma cells, or biopsy proven plasmacytoma which must be obtained within  weeks prior to registration\r\n* Measurable levels of M-protein: >=  g/dL on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) or >=  mg of monoclonal light chain on a  hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) or involved free light chain (FLC) >=  mg/dL (>=  mg/L) which must be obtained within  weeks prior to registration\r\nSerum and urine M-protein levels should be determined by electrophoresis rather than by quantitative immunoglobulin (Ig) measurement; exceptions are made in cases in which the M-spike value may be deemed to be unreliable (e.g. co-migrating M-spike); in these cases, quantitative Ig should be used; to assess response and progression, however, SPEP values should only be compared to SPEP values and quantitative Ig values only to quantitative Ig values
