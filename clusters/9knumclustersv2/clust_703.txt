Proteinuria =< grade  (ie, =< + [ mg/dL] using a random urine sample or < . gm using a -hour sample)\r\n* Note: if urine sample indicates >= grade  proteinuria (ie, + [ mg/dL]), a -hour urine sample must be collected and tested; urine protein in the -hour sample must be < . gm/ hours
Persistent proteinuria >= grade  NCI-CTCAE v. (> . g/ hrs, measured by urine protein:creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)
Proteinuria =< + ( mg/dL) using a random urine sample or < . gm using a -hour sample; Note: If urine sample indicates >= + [ mg/dL]), a -hour urine sample must be collected and tested; urine protein in the -hour sample must be < . gm/ hours
Proteinuria of CTCAE grade  or higher (estimated by urine protein: creatinine ratio >= . on a random urine sample); patients who recently (i.e., at least  days prior to registration) discontinued an anti-angiogenic therapy which caused proteinuria (ie, grade  (>  to >  g of protein or -. g/ hours [h]) or grade  proteinuria (>  of protein or > . g/ h) are not eligible for enrollment until proteinuria improves to <  g of protein per  h
Proteinuria >= grade  (> . g/ hours, measured by urine protein: creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)

Patients with a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria must have < grade  proteinuria per NCI CTCAE v. at screening; if a patient has a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria, a urine protein test will be performed on a random urine sample; if the result is normal then no additional testing is required; if the result is abnormal, a  hour urine will be collected to determine if proteinuria is < grade 
Patients with a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria must have < grade  proteinuria per NCI CTCAE v. at screening; if a patient has a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria, a urine protein test will be performed on a random urine sample; if the result is normal then no additional testing is required; if the result is abnormal, a  hour urine will be collected to determine if proteinuria is < grade
