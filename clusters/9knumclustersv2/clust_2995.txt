QT corrected by Bazzett's formula (QTcB) must be <  milliseconds (ms) for males and <  ms for females
Has a mean QTcF prolongation > ms for females and > ms for males in three successive Screening measurements.
Has a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) >  ms using the Fridericia formula; if the screening electrocardiogram (ECG) has a QTc > ms, the mean QTc of  electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be utilized, but must be <  ms
Patients, who continue to have prolonged corrected QT (QTc) (males: >  ms; females: >  ms as calculated by Fridericias correction formula) despite normal electrolyte balance and discontinuation of medications known to prolong QTc, will be excluded from the study
Electrocardiogram (EKG) with QTcB (Bazetts formula) >  ms done within  days of enrollment
Prolonged QTc greater than or equal to  ms. If QTc greater than or equal to ms, confirmation of eligible QTc requires mean calculation from  additional electrocardiograms (ECGs) ? minutes apart using Fridericia's Correction Formula (mean less than  ms).
Has a corrected QT prolongation to >  millisecond (ms) in males and >  ms in females
Cardiac MRI T* <ms;
QTc interval <  ms
QTcb > ms
Within  days of registration: Corrected QT interval (QTc) must be <  ms in males and <  ms in females
A prolonged QTc of >=  ms interval on electrocardiogram
Has a QTc prolongation to >  millisecond (ms) in males and >  ms in females
QTc interval of >  ms.
Evidence of QTcF prolongation defined as >  ms for males and >  ms for females at screening
Mean QT interval ? ms
QRS interval ? ms
PR interval ? ms
Patients must not have a prolonged PR interval (defined as >  ms).
For mefloquine arm, patients with evidence of QTc interval >  ms or clinically significant arrhythmia on baseline EKG obtained within  days of registration will be ineligible for protocol enrollment
MS INCLUSION:
ECG: QTc interval ?  ms
Has a QTc prolongation to >  millisecond (ms) in males and >  ms in females.
Cardiac ejection fraction ?%, and QTcF< ms (males) or < ms (females) on ECG at Baseline.
Patients should not be allergic to eggs or soy beans. Patients must be medically, psychologically and neurologically stable and have triplicate baseline ECG's with a mean QTc interval < ms and > ms and neither a history of congenital prolonged or short QT syndrome. Patients with a history of cardiac disease must be stable.
QTcF corrected with Frederica's or Bazett's formula QTcB > ms for males and > ms for females on screening ECG.
QTc interval prolongation >ms for males and > ms for females.

Prolonged QTC interval >ms
Prolonged QTc interval (males >ms, females >ms)
Prolonged QTc interval (males >ms, females >ms)
Corrected (Bazett) QTc interval of > . ms (male) or > . ms (female)
Q-T interval of =<  ms as measured by electrocardiography (EKG)
Evidence of QT prolongation on pretreatment electrocardiography (ECG) (greater than  ms in males or greater than  ms in females)
Evidence of QT prolongation on pretreatment electrocardiogram (ECG) (greater than  ms in males or greater than  ms in females)
Evidence of QT prolongation on pretreatment electrocardiogram (ECG) (greater than  ms in males or greater than  ms in females)
Prolonged QTc interval defined as greater than  ms.
Subjects with QTc interval > ms.
QTcF interval > ms for men and > ms for women, symptomatic bradycardia < beats per minute or other significant ECG abnormalities in the investigator's opinion.
QTc >  ms (M) or  ms (F) (Bazett formula -QT Interval / ? (RR interval) where RR Interval = /HR).
