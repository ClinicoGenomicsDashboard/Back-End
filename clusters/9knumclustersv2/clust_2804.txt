Patients must have received a clinical diagnosis of lymphedema for at least  months and no more than  years; this timeframe allows ample time for any surgically related non-lymphedema swelling to subside by  months post-surgery, while a cap of  years will capture the broadest range of cases, and has been used as a timeframe in several studies including our pilot study
