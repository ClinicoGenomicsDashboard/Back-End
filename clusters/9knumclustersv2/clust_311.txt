History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or ventricular fibrillation [VF], greater than or equal to  beats in a row); QTc greater than or equal to  msec for men and  msec for women; or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to % by multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA).
Patients must have a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) equal to or greater than the lower limit of normal for the radiology facility and if there are two consecutive MUGAS performed while on trastuzumab from the same radiology facility, there cannot be a decrease in LVEF of > % from the original MUGA scan
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be equal to or greater than %, as measured by multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be equal to or greater than %, as measured by multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater or equal to % at baseline as determined by either echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA), or within the institutions normal limits
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to % on technetium-m pertechnetate radionuclide cineangiography (multi gated acquisition scan [MUGA]) or echocardiogram
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to % on technetium-m pertechnetate radionuclide cineangiography (multi gate acquisition scan [MUGA]) or echocardiogram
