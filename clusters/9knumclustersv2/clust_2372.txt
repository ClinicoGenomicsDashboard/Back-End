Random or fasting blood glucose =< the upper normal limits for age; if the initial blood glucose is a random sample that is outside of the normal limits, then follow-up fasting blood glucose can be obtained and must be =< the upper normal limits for age
Patients must have a normal blood sugar level for age to participate; if an initial random draw (ie. non-fasting) blood glucose value is out of range, it is acceptable to repeat this test as a fasting draw
Patients must have a normal blood sugar level for age; if an initial random draw (i.e. non-fasting) blood glucose value is out of range, it is acceptable to repeat this test as a fasting draw
Random or fasting blood glucose within the upper normal limits for age; if the initial blood glucose is a random sample that is outside of the normal limits, then a follow-up fasting (no food or drink other than water for  hours) blood glucose can be obtained and must be within the upper limits for age
Normal blood glucose for age
Subject with poor blood glucose control as per glycosylated hemoglobin > %.
Fasting glucose within normal limits
Fasting or random blood glucose within the upper limits of normal for age
If random blood glucose is above upper limits for age, a fasting blood glucose can be obtained and must be within normal limits for age
Blood glucose <. ULN within  days of enrollment to study
Within  days of first vaccination: Blood glucose < . ULN
Glucose =<  x ULN
Random or fasting blood glucose within the upper normal limits for age; if the initial blood glucose is a random sample that is outside of the normal limits, then a follow-up fasting blood glucose can be obtained and must be within the upper normal limits for age
Fasting blood glucose within institutional normal limits
Additional criteria for Group B participants who will receive upfront window therapy (does not apply to participants who opt out of window therapy):\r\n* Cytochrome P A (CYPA) active agents: must not be taking any of the following potent CYPA inducers or inhibitors within  week prior to study entry: azole antifungals (such as fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole), rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, grapefruit juice and St. Johns wort\r\n* Must have measurable disease\r\n* Must not have received emergent radiation therapy\r\n* Serum triglyceride level =<  mg/dL and serum cholesterol =<  mg/dL\r\n* Random or fasting glucose within the upper limits of normal for age; if random glucose is elevated, fasting glucose must be within normal range
Have a random glucose of =<  or >= 
Patients who require frequent (several times a day) monitoring of their blood glucose or patients who have recently been hospitalized for glucose control
Patients with fasting capillary blood glucose of >  on the day of surgery
It is recommended glucose be drawn fasting >=  hrs; glucose <  (diabetics  years of age are not eligible), within  days prior to enrollment\r\n* If glucose is >=  the glucose should be repeated fasting to determine eligibility
Glucose within  x ULN
Blood glucose > 
Blood glucose >=  mg/dL at the time of PET-MRI (or if diabetic, uncontrolled blood glucose); at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) and the authorized user and with their approval prior to FDG injection, patients with blood glucose >=  mg/dL may participate in the study
