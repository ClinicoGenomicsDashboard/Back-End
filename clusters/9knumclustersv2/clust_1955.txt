Castrate serum testosterone (<  ng/dL)
Castrate resistant progression of prostate carcinoma, as shown by:\r\n* Serum testosterone level =<  ng/dL or prior bilateral orchiectomy; treatment to remain castrate levels of testosterone should continue, and\r\n* Either symptomatic progression, or, if patient is asymptomatic then a rising serum PSA in two occasions at least  week apart, with minimum pre-treatment serum PSA of  ng/dL
