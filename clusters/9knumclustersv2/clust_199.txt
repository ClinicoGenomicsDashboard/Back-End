Maintenance or switch maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy will be considered part of the first-line regimen and is acceptable. Participants who completed and progressed on a platinum-containing regimen as adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or part of a course of chemoradiation therapy given from locally advanced disease and developed recurrent (local or metastatic) disease within the  months before screening would be counted as having received  prior platinum-containing regimen and therefore would not require re-treatment with a platinum-containing regimen for Stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent disease and are eligible.
