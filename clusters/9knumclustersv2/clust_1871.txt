Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin ?. x upper limit of normal (ULN), AST ?. x ULN, ALT ?. x ULN, alkaline phosphatase (liver fraction) ?. x ULN
Alkaline phosphatase (liver fraction) =< . X ULN; if AST or ALT is > . X ULN, then liver fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be =< . X ULN

To commence third line docetaxel, patients must have grade  or less neuropathy from prior oxaliplatin treatment; also bilirubin > upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and/or ALT > . x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > . x ULN are not eligible for docetaxel therapy
AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and Alkaline phosphatase > . times ULN
Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be > the ULN; for example, if the alkaline phosphatase is > the ULN but =< . x ULN, the AST must be =< the ULN; if the AST is > the ULN but =< . x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be =< ULN; Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be =< . x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be =< . x ULN
* Patients with a history of Gilberts syndrome may be eligible provided total bilirubin is less than or equal to . x ULN and the AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase meet the criteria detailed
Adequate liver functions: AST and ALT =< xULN, alkaline phosphatase =< .x ULN, except if attributed to tumor, and bilirubin =< xULN.
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase must be within the eligible; in determining eligibility, the more abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be used; patients with alkaline phosphatase elevation secondary to the bony metastases rather than liver dysfunction may proceed with treatment on protocol after discussion with the principal investigator

Hepatic: Bilirubin ? . mg/dL (except in the case of Gilbert's syndrome or ongoing hemolytic anemia); and ALT, AST and Alkaline Phosphatase ?   ULN.
Alkaline phosphatase (AP) must be within the range allowing for eligibility, as follows:\r\n* =< ULN\r\n* =< . x ULN\r\n* =<  x ULN
Alkaline phosphatase and AST/ALT may not both be > the ULN; for example, if the alkaline phosphatase is > the ULN but =< . x ULN, then the AST/ALT must be =< the ULN; if the AST/ALT is > the ULN but =< . x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be =< ULN
Patients with AST/ALT or alkaline phosphatase > ULN must have liver imaging that does not demonstrate metastatic disease
