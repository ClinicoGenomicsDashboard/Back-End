Patients must have recovered from any surgical procedure before enrolling on this study:\r\n* Patients with a major surgical procedure within  days prior to enrollment should be excluded\r\n* Patients with an intermediate surgical procedure within  days prior to enrollment should be excluded\r\n* For minor surgical procedures (including Broviac line or infusaport placement), patients should not receive the first planned dose of bevacizumab until the wound is healed and at least  days have elapsed\r\n* There should be no anticipation of need for major surgical procedures during the course of the study\r\n** Examples of major, intermediate, or minor surgical procedures:\r\n*** Major procedures: Major craniotomy for tumor resection; organ resection; bowel wall anastomosis; arteriovenous grafts; exploratory laparotomy; thoracotomy\r\n*** Intermediate procedures: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP)-shunt placement; stereotactic brain biopsy\r\n*** Minor procedures: Incision and drainage of superficial skin abscesses; punch biopsy of skin lesions; superficial skin wound suturing; bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy; fine needle aspirations; Broviac line or infusaport placement; paracentesis or thoracocentesis\r\n* Please note: Lumbar punctures or placement of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines are not considered minor procedures and may occur at any time prior to or during therapy
