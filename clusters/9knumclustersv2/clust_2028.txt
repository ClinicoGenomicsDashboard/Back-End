Hemoglobin >=  g/dL, within  weeks of randomization
Within  weeks prior to randomization: Hemoglobin must be >=  g/dL
STEP I: Hemoglobin >=  g/dL (obtained within  days prior to randomization)
Hemoglobin >=  g/dL within  days prior to step  randomization
Hemoglobin >  g/dL, obtained within  weeks prior to randomization
Hemoglobin >= . g/dL measured within  days prior to randomization
Hemoglobin >= . g/L within  weeks before randomization
Obtained within  days prior randomization: hemoglobin must be >=  g/dL
Hemoglobin >= . g/dL, within  weeks of randomization
Hemoglobin ? . g/dL independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within  months prior to randomization
Within  days of randomization: Hemoglobin >=  g/dL
Hemoglobin >= . g/dL within  days prior to randomization
Obtained within  days of randomization: Hemoglobin >= . g/dL
Hemoglobin >= . g/dL, independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within  months prior to randomization
Obtained =<  days prior to randomization: Hemoglobin >= . g/dL
Hemoglobin of >=  g/dL, independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within  months prior to randomization
Hemoglobin >= . g/dL, independent of transfusion and/or growth factors within  months prior to randomization
Obtained =<  days prior to randomization:\r\nHemoglobin > . g/dL
Within  days prior to randomization: Hemoglobin must be >=  g/dL
Hemoglobin ? . g/dL without transfusion and/or growth factors in the  months prior to randomization
Hemoglobin must be >=  g/dL within  days before randomization
Hemoglobin >=  g/dL within four weeks prior to randomization
Hemoglobin >=  g/dL continuation of erythropoietin products is permitted obtained =<  days prior to randomization; hemoglobin must be stable >=  g/dL >=  days without blood transfusion to maintain hemoglobin level
Hemoglobin > . g/dL (obtained =<  days prior to randomization)
Hemoglobin >= . g/dL (hemoglobin may be supported by transfusion) obtained =< days prior to randomization
Hemoglobin >= . g/dL obtained =<  days prior to randomization
Hemoglobin >= . g/deciliter should be obtained with  days prior to randomization
Hemoglobin ?  g/dL ( g/L) within  days prior to randomization
Hemoglobin level less than or equal to . g/dL as assessed by the local laboratory; sample obtained within  days prior to randomization (retest in screening is acceptable).
Hemoglobin >=  g/dL or hematocrit >= % obtained =<  days prior to randomization
Hemoglobin >=  g/dL (. mmol/L) (evaluated within  days of randomization); subjects may not have had a transfusion within  days of screening assessment
