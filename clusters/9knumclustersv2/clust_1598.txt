Corrected serum calcium <  mg/dL, and no evidence of symptomatic hypercalcemia; (corrected serum calcium is calculated by adding . mg/dL to the measured serum calcium for every  g/dL that the serum albumin falls below . g/dL)

Total serum calcium (corrected for serum albumin) >= . mg/dL or ionized calcium >= . mg/dL
Calcium (MM only): corrected calcium < . mg/dL within  weeks prior to study registration
Corrected calcium >= . mg/dL within  weeks of randomization
Corrected serum calcium > . mg/dl within  weeks of enrollment
Subjects with serum calcium (corrected for albumin) >=  mg/dL
Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) before the first dose of ceritinib
Total serum calcium (corrected for serum albumin) >= . mg/dL or ionized calcium >= . mg/dL
Corrected serum calcium level of > . mg/dL (serum corrected calcium = serum calcium + .[-serum albumin])
