History of other malignancy unless the subject has been disease-free for at least  years; non-invasive cancer history (such as carcinoma in situ [CIS] that has been resected) is allowed
Active malignancy within the previous  years (other than completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ)
History of another malignancy; \r\n* Exception: Subjects who have been disease-free for  years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or subjects with indolent second malignancies are eligible
History of another malignancy; exception: subjects who have been disease-free for  years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or subjects with indolent (early stage breast cancer or prostate cancer) second malignancies are eligible after discussion with the study principal investigator (PI)
History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been disease-free for  years, or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible
History of another active malignancy in last  years; exception: subjects who have been disease-free for  years, or subjects with a history of completely resected nonmelanoma skin cancer and/or subjects with indolent second malignancies are eligible
History of a prior malignancy within past  years are excluded unless they have been disease free for  or more years or unless they have a completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer
Presence or History of another malignancy. Exception: Patients who have been disease-free for  years, or patients with a history of adequately treated in-situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix, completely resected basal or squamous cell carcinoma, non-melanomatous cancer of skin, history of stage IA melanoma that has been cured, are eligible.
History of another malignancy\r\n* Exception: patients who have been disease-free for  years, or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or patients with indolent secondary malignancies, are eligible
History of another malignancy. Subjects with another malignancy are eligible if: (a) disease-free for  years, or (b) have a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer, and/or (c) have an indolent second malignancy(ies).
Patients with a history of a prior malignancy are excluded unless they have been disease free for  or more years or unless they have a completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer, and/or subjects with indolent second malignancies
Patients with a history of other malignancy; patients who have been disease-free from other malignancy for  years or greater, or patients with a history of resected non-melanoma skin cancer, or patients with a history of treated in situ carcinoma will be allowed
History of another malignancy (except subjects who have been disease free for  years or with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer)
History of other malignancy. Subjects who have been disease-free for  years or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer (basal or squamous) are eligible
History of another active malignancy within the past  years, or any malignancy with a confirmed activating RAS mutation. The prospective RAS mutation testing is not required, however, if results of previous RAS testing are known, they must be used in assessing eligibility. Subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer are eligible.
