Technical contraindications to epidural placement: previous thoracic spinal surgery or local skin or soft tissue infection at proposed site for epidural insertion
All patients must have a thoracic epidural placed pre-operatively for perioperative analgesia; epidural will be loaded with  mg of duramorph after induction of anesthesia and will be started at a rate of  ml/hr upon the conclusion of the surgery; a solution of . % bupivacaine with  mcg/ml epinephrine will be used for analgesia; epidural rate will be adjusted for optimal coverage and stable hemodynamics
Patients must be eligible for epidural placement
Patients with epidural compression are eligible provided that there is a >=  mm gap between the spinal cord and the edge of the epidural lesion
Known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery (including radiosurgery) and stable for at least  months before study enrollment; eligible subjects must be without corticosteroid treatment at the time of study enrollment
