Adequate Bone Marrow Function defined as:\r\n* Peripheral absolute phagocyte count (APC) > / L; APC = numbers of banded neutrophils + segmented neutrophils + metamyelocytes + monocytes + eosinophils Please note, if institution reports differential as a percentage, then APC = [percentage of banded neutrophils + segmented neutrophils+ metamyelocytes+monocytes+eosinophils] x total white cell count.\r\n* Platelet Count > ,/L (transfusion independent)\r\n* Hemoglobin >  gm/dL (may have received RBC transfusions)
