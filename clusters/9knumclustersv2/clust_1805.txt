Low dose warfarin ( mg orally, once daily) with PT-INR ? . x ULN is permitted. Infrequent bleeding or elevations in PT-INR have been reported in some subjects taking warfarin while on regorafenib therapy. Therefore, subjects taking concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in PT, PT-INR, or clinical bleeding episodes.
