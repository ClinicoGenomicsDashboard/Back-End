Risk of cancer greater than % or less than %
All patients must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of neuroblastoma, < . years of age and classified as high risk at the time of diagnosis. Exception: patients who are initially diagnosed as non-high-risk neuroblastoma, but later converted (and/or relapsed) to high risk neuroblastoma are also eligible.
Women must be considered at high risk for breast cancer based on family history (first or second degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of ), prior precancerous biopsy or a -year Gail model risk estimate of >= .% or -year Tyrer-Cuzick risk of  x population risk as listed in the model
RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL: Utilizing the breast cancer surveillance consortium risk calculator, women will have either (a) an intermediate -year risk (> .%-.%) and extremely dense breasts or (b) a high -year risk (>= .%) and either heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts
At high risk of developing breast cancer defined by one or more of the following: Gail model lifetime risk > %, a history of deleterious BRCA/ mutation or mantle radiation, a history of ductal cancer in situ, or a history of high risk premalignant breast lesion.
Enrolled on the longitudinal high risk cohort study or being seen in the Cancer Prevention Center
High-risk indoor tanner (defined as using an indoor tanning bed at least  times in the previous  months)
High risk medical condition (e.g. kidney disease)
Projected probability of developing breast cancer by either the Gail model (-year risk) or the TyrerCuzick model (-year risk) that is at least -fold greater than that for the population; for the Gail model any value of -year risk >= .% satisfies the requirement
. Subjects with breast, lung or pancreatic carcinoma who are at high risk of relapse post definitive therapy at least  and no more than  weeks from completion of definitive therapy at the time of signing informed consent as described below for each indication:
Subjects who are at high risk for breast cancer will be considered for participation in the study
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR HIGH RISK PATIENTS FOR THE CLINICAL TRIAL
Subject considered by the Investigator to be high-risk for breast conservation surgery and/or intra-operative radiation therapy
Is receiving chemotherapeutic agent(s) associated with moderate or high risk of emetogenicity, or a chemotherapy regimen not previously tolerated due to vomiting
For patients at high risk for developing aGVHD, informed consent should be signed prior to transplant.
High risk benign lesions as the primary pathology diagnosis
Patients who are on anticoagulants or high dose aspirin therapy that cannot be safely stopped for greater than  days prior to treatment should be excluded to limit increased risk for urinary obstruction
Patients with low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk tumors according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (.) will be included
Participants at higher risk due to age, frailty, or the emergent nature of their condition
HIGH-RISK POPULATION:
Extensive prior surgery/radiation present that would render the biopsy highly complex and the risk of intraoperative injury high
Patients at risk for fall or who have had recent fractures
High risk medical condition (e.g. kidney disease, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.)
Any co morbid condition that in the view of the attending physician renders the patient at high risk from ketorolac treatment complications
High risk patients
Prostate adenocarcinoma with High Risk (HR) and Unfavorable Intermediate Risk (UIR) for recurrence classification as determined by one of the following combinations: o High risk (HR): subjects with one or more of the following risk factors:
N o Unfavorable Intermediate Risk (UIR): subjects with no HR features but with one or more of the following adverse risk factors:
Declared high-risk for anesthesia by attending anesthesiologist, cardiologist, or other physician
