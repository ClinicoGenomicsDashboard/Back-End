Central nervous system (CNS) involvement; CNS status must be confirmed by lumbar puncture\r\n* Note: lumbar puncture can be performed at the time of diagnosis and does not need to be repeated unless there is a change in neurological status or it was performed more than  days prior to study entry
NOTE: A lumbar puncture is not required in order to be enrolled on study nor are lumbar punctures recommended at the time of diagnosis; if the diagnosis of APL is known or suspected, diagnostic lumbar punctures in patients with neurologic symptoms should be deferred until any coagulopathy is corrected; if central nervous system (CNS) disease is suspected or proven, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered to rule out the possibility of an associated chloroma; if CNS disease is documented, patients are still eligible and will receive protocol directed intrathecal treatments
Patients must have a lumbar puncture to determine CNS involvement of ALL within  days prior to registration; patients with CNS are excluded from the trial; patients with CNS or CNS will be eligible, but will be monitored for CNS involvement; note that intrathecal methotrexate administered during the pre-study lumbar puncture may count as the first dose of intrathecal therapy required as part of the study

Patients must not have active central nervous system (CNS) involvement (by clinical evaluation); patients with previous documented history of CNS involvement of acute leukemia, or with clinical signs or symptoms consistent with CNS involvement of acute leukemia, must have a lumbar puncture which is negative for CNS involvement of acute leukemia; the lumbar puncture must be completed within  days prior to registration; patients with no previous history of documented CNS involvement and with no clinical signs or symptoms consistent with CNS involvement are not required to have completed a lumbar puncture before registration; note that treatment with intrathecal therapy is recommended during protocol treatment but CNS analysis during treatment is not required
Participants must have a lumbar puncture with negative cerebral spinal fluid cytology within  weeks prior to enrollment
Mantle cell NHL: may be treated in first complete remission (CR); (diagnostic lumbar puncture [LP] required pre-transplant)

Patients with clinical contraindication against lumbar puncture or Ommaya placement are NOT eligible for either Stratum
Clinical evidence of (parenchymal or meningeal) central nervous system (CNS) involvement or metastasis; in subjects suspected of having CNS disease, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and lumbar puncture should be done to confirm
Active central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma within two weeks of registration; patients with a history of CNS involvement must have adequate treatment as defined by at least two negative spinal fluid assessments separated by at least one week; (otherwise lumbar puncture [LP] is not required if no clinical suspicion or evidence of CNS involvement); patients who have received cranial radiation therapy must still be eligible to receive total lymphoid irradiation to  Gy
Suspected AML-related central nervous system involvement; a lumbar puncture (LP) is not required to exclude central nervous system (CNS) disease
Subjects must not have prior or active central nervous system (CNS) involvement (e.g. leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal masses) with myeloma; screening for this (e.g. with lumbar puncture) is not required unless suspicious symptoms are present
Active central nervous system (CNS) disease defined as symptomatic meningeal lymphoma or known CNS parenchymal lymphoma; a lumbar puncture demonstrating DLBCL at the time of registration to this study is not exclusion for study enrollment
Known central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or leukemia; subjects with symptoms of CNS disease must have a negative computed tomography (CT) scan or negative diagnostic lumbar puncture prior to first dose
Central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement not clearing with intrathecal chemotherapy; diagnostic lumbar puncture is to be performed
Known cytopathologically confirmed CNS infiltration (in absence of suspicion of CNS involvement, lumbar puncture not required)
Patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) involvement should undergo lumbar puncture; those with documented CNS involvement will be excluded
Central nervous system involvement; a lumbar puncture does not need to be performed unless there is clinical suspicion of leptomeningeal disease
Patients with suspected or proven central nervous system (CNS) leukemia; (diagnostic lumbar puncture not required before enrollment)
History of known leptomeningeal involvement (lumbar puncture not required)
Patients must not have active involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) with MM (by clinical evaluation); patients with documentation of, or clinical signs or symptoms consistent with, CNS involvement of MM must have a lumbar puncture that is negative for CNS involvement of MM; the lumbar puncture must be completed within  days prior to registration; patients with no previous history of documented CNS involvement and with no clinical signs or symptoms consistent with CNS involvement are not required to have completed a lumbar puncture prior to registration; note that monitoring of CNS involvement and treatment with intrathecal therapy is recommended during protocol treatment
Patients must be able to tolerate lumbar puncture and/or Ommaya taps
Known central nervous system lymphoma or leukemia; subjects with symptoms of CNS disease must have a negative CT scan or negative diagnostic lumbar puncture prior to randomization
Current clinical central nervous system (CNS) symptoms deemed by the investigator to be related to leukaemic CNS involvement (no lumbar puncture required, clinical assessment per investigators judgement is sufficient).
Central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement not clearing with intrathecal chemotherapy and/or cranial radiation prior to initiation of conditioning; diagnostic lumbar puncture is to be performed per protocol
Known cytopathologically confirmed central nervous system (CNS) infiltration (in absence of suspicion of CNS involvement, lumbar puncture not required)

Known active and uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) involvement of leukemia (a lumbar puncture does not need to be performed as a part of screening)
