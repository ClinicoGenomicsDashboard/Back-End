Colorectal carcinoma (CRC).
Histologically or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of metastatic KRAS wildtype colorectal cancer (CRC)

Metastatic or recurrent CRC
Must not have received prior systemic chemotherapy for Stage IV CRC
Retinoblastoma-positive, histologically proven CRC with measurable disease
CRC: at least  prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting, and as appropriate in patients whose tumors are microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), pembrolizumab as well.
Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of CRC
Metastatic CRC not amenable to surgical resection
CRC (Colorectal cancer): Patients with metastatic CRC and known KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) status who are eligible for treatment with regorafenib in accordance with the approved labeling.

Patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed refractory colorectal cancer (CRC)
Patients with solid tumor other than CRC.
