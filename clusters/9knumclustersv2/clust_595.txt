A condom is required to be used also by vasectomised males in order to\n             prevent potential delivery of the study drug via seminal fluid. Female partners of\n             male patients must be advised to also use one of the following contraception methods:\n\n               -  intrauterine device or intrauterine system;\n\n               -  prior sterilisation; or\n\n               -  total abstinence from male/female intercourse.\n\n          .

Highly effective methods for birth control include the following:\n\n               -  Total abstinence: This is an acceptable method when this is consistent with the\n                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,\n                  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are\n                  not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\n               -  Female sterilisation: The patient has had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with\n                  or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least  weeks prior to taking study\n                  drug. In case of an oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status of the patient\n                  must have been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.\n\n               -  Male partner sterilisation: The patient has the appropriate post-vasectomy\n                  documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. (For female patients on\n                  the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that\n                  patient.) These patients must also agree to the use an intrauterine device or\n                  intrauterine system AND a barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive\n                  cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, or\n                  cream, or vaginal suppository. Reliable contraception must be maintained\n                  throughout the study and for  weeks after study drug discontinuation.\n\n               -  Females considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential: The\n                  definition applies to females who have had  months of natural (spontaneous)\n                  amenorrhoea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history\n                  of vasomotor symptoms) or  months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with serum\n                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels >  million international units per\n                  milliliter (mIU/mL) (for US only: and estradiol <  pg/mL) or have had surgical\n                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least  weeks prior to\n                  starting treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive\n                  status of the patient has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is\n                  she considered not of childbearing potential.\n\n          . Is a pregnant or nursing (lactating) female, where pregnancy is defined as the state\n             of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a\n             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (>  mIU/mL).\n\n          .

For Arm C: Patients\n        must have clinical and/or radiographic evidence of first recurrence of glioblastoma (only)\n        and be eligible for salvage surgical resection as deemed by the site Investigator.\n\n        Must be  weeks from radiotherapy. If patients are within  weeks of radiotherapy, then\n        the progressive lesion must be outside of the high-dose radiation target volume or have\n        unequivocal evidence of progressive tumor on a biopsy specimen.\n\n        From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have\n        elapsed:  half-lives from any investigational agent,  weeks from cytotoxic therapy\n        (except  days for temozolomide and  weeks from nitrosoureas),  weeks from antibodies,\n        or  weeks (or  half-lives, whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.\n\n        All adverse events Grade >  related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or\n        surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia.\n\n        Male or Female age ? years.\n\n        Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ? % (see Appendix A).\n\n        Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below, all screening labs should be performed\n        within  days of treatment initiation:\n\n          -  leukocytes ? ,/mcL\n\n          -  absolute neutrophil count ? ,/mcL\n\n          -  platelets ? ,/mcL\n\n          -  hemoglobin > . mg/dL\n\n          -  total bilirubin < . x upper limit of normal\n\n          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ?.  upper limit of normal creatinine OR creatinine clearance\n             ? mL/min/. m for patients with creatinine levels above normal.\n\n        CT or MRI within  days prior to start of study drug.\n\n        Corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least  days prior to the scan.

If the recurrent lesion is outside of any prior\n        high-dose radiation target volume or distant from the prior CED or brachytherapy site,\n        subjects will be considered eligible\n\n        Pregnant women because ONC is novel agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or\n        abortifacient effects.

Must have an archival FFPE tumor sample available, to be provided to the Sponsor upon\n             request.\n\n          .
