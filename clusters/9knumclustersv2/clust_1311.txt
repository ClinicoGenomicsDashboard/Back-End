Auto-immune disease including inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, but not including hypothyroidism or psoriasis if condition has been stable for  months or greater
History of auto-immune disease (e.g., thyroiditis, lupus), except vitiligo
No active auto-immune disease and not on therapy for auto-immune disease. Patients with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement hormone are eligible. Patients who have adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis from prior immunotherapy if they are on stable medical replacement doses are eligible
Life expectancy of >  months (exclusive of the disease for which the auto HSCT is being performed)
Active auto-immune disease including connective tissue disease, uveitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or multiple sclerosis, or have a history of severe (as judged by the principal investigator) autoimmune disease requiring prolonged immunosuppressive therapy
Have active auto-immune disease, including connective tissue disease, uveitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or multiple sclerosis, or have a history of severe (as judged by the principal investigator) autoimmune disease requiring prolonged immunosuppressive therapy
The subject has a history of, or is reasonably suspected to meet criteria for the diagnosis of a systemic auto-immune/inflammatory disease or other autoimmune disorder with the exception of:\r\n* Vitiligo
Patients with auto-immune disease, with the exception of type I diabetes or treated hypothyroidism.
Significant auto-immune disease requiring hospitalization within the past two years or any history of life-threatening auto-immune disease
Subjects must not have active auto-immune disease, including connective tissue disease, uveitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or multiple sclerosis, or have a history of severe (as judged by the principal investigator) autoimmune disease requiring prolonged immunosuppressive therapy
PHASE I STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\r\nHistory of auto-immune disease requiring steroid maintenance, or history of primary immunodeficiency
Prior auto-immune disease
Active autoimmune or auto-inflammatory ocular disease within  months
History of auto-immune disease per physician discretion
The subject has a history of, or is reasonably suspected to meet criteria for the diagnosis of a systemic auto-immune/inflammatory disease or other autoimmune disorder with the exception of: vitiligo, diabetes or thyroid dysfunction
Patients with active auto-immune disease requiring immunosuppressive medication
Auto-immune hemolytic anemia
Ongoing clinically significant anemia due to factors such as iron, vitamin B, or folate deficiencies, auto-immune or hereditary hemolysis, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
