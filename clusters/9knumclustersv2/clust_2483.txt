Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy and be at least  weeks from the last dose of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biological therapy and at least  week from the last dose of non-myelosuppressive biologic therapy; any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the principal investigators; for those who have received radiation,  weeks must have elapsed before beginning vaccination

Patients on Strata C and D must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to grade  or better; patients must be at least  weeks form the last dose of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biological therapy, at least  week from the last dose of non-myelosuppressive biologic therapy and at least  months from placement of bis-chloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) wafers; any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the principal investigator
Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: must not have received within  days of entry onto this study ( days if prior nitrosourea drug) accompanied by hematopoietic recovery or  days of stopping non-myelosuppressive therapy as long as hematopoietic requirements are met
Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other chemotherapy known to be myelosuppressive: ? days after the last dose of cytotoxic or myelosuppressive chemotherapy ( days if prior nitrosourea).
Last dose of any myelosuppressive or biologic therapy was given at least  weeks before the start date for vorinostat on this protocol

Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: at least  days after the last dose of myelosuppressive chemotherapy ( days if prior nitrosourea)
MDS: No previous myelosuppressive therapy; for the purpose of this protocol myelosuppressive chemotherapy will be defined as chemotherapy given with the intent of inducing a complete remission (e.g., standard +, high dose intermittent ARA-C [HIDAC], or Mylotarg)
