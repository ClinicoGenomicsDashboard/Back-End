History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic medications, except for atrial fibrillation that is well controlled with anti arrhythmic medication.
Patients with significant cardiovascular disease are excluded, including:\r\n* Myocardial infarction, severe angina, or unstable angina within  months prior to administration of first dose of study drug\r\n* History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)\r\n* Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic medications (except for atrial fibrillation that is well controlled with anti-arrhythmic medication)\r\n* Coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft within  months of screening\r\n* History of class III or IV congestive heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association
Current cardiac arrhythmic condition requiring concurrent use of anti-arrhythmic drug; rate controlled atrial fibrillation is allows
Patients may not have symptomatic coronary artery disease and may not be on cardiac medications for anti-arrhythmic or inotropic effects
History/presence of arrhythmia (even controlled) on chemical anti-arrhythmic(s) must have cardiac consult to ensure the subject could safely proceed with protocol requirements

Patients with cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy are not eligible
History of cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy within past  months
Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy
Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic medications (Subject with rate controlled atrial fibrillation for >  month prior to first dose of study drugs are eligible)

Need for anti-arrhythmic therapy for a ventricular arrhythmias
Patients with cardiac arrhythmias must not be receiving anti-arrhythmic medication at time of study entry (or while on study).
High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, high-grade atrioventricular [AV]-block, supra-ventricular arrhythmias which are not adequately rate-controlled) that require current treatment with the following anti-arrhythmic drugs: flecainide, moricizine or propafenone
