Patients receiving chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent\r\n* Note: topical applications (e.g. rash), inhaled sprays (e.g. obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular) are allowed; patients with previously treated brain metastases, who are on stable low dose corticosteroids treatment (e.g. dexamethasone  mg/day, prednisolone  mg/day) for at least  days before start of study treatment are eligible
Patients receiving chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent; note: topical applications (e.g. for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g. for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular) are allowed; patients with previously treated brain metastases, who are on stable low dose corticosteroids treatment (e.g. dexamethasone  mg/day, predisolone  mg/day) for at least  days before start of study treatment are eligible
Patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive agents or chronic corticosteroids use at the time of study entry except for control of brain metastases, topical applications, inhaled sprays, eye drops or local injections
Patients receiving chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent\r\n* Note: Topical applications (e.g. rash), inhaled sprays (e.g. obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular) are allowed; patients with previously treated brain metastases, who are on stable low dose corticosteroid treatment (e,g dexamethasone  mg/day, prednisolone  mg/day) for at least  days before start of study treatment are eligible
Use of more than low dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone up to but no more than  mg PO QD or its equivalent) for symptom management and comorbid conditions, except for the following:\r\n* Topical applications (e.g. rash)\r\n* Inhaled sprays (e.g. obstructive airways diseases)\r\n* Eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular)\r\n* Joint injections (e.g. arthritis)\r\nDoses of corticosteroid should be stable for at least  days prior to registration
Patients receiving chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent other than specified above\r\n* Note: Topical applications (e.g. rash), inhaled sprays (e.g. obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular) are allowed; patients with previously treated brain metastases, who are on stable low dose corticosteroids treatment (eg. dexamethasone  mg/day, prednisolone  mg/day) for at least  days before start of study treatment are eligible
Patients currently receiving chronic systemic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent; NOTE: this restriction regarding choice of glucocorticoid does not apply should patient need <  week course of glucocorticoid for treatment of noninfectious pneumonitis during study, or if ARM C patient with brain metastases treated with glucocorticoid is enrolled; topical applications (e.g., rash), inhaled sprays, eye drops or local injections of steroids are allowed
Patients receiving chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent\r\n* Note: topical applications (eg, rash), inhaled sprays (eg, obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (eg, intr-articular) are allowed; oral or systemic liver enzyme inhibitors such as topical antifungal creams are allowed; patients with previously treated brain metastases, who are on stable low dose corticosteriods treatment (eg, dexamethasone  mg/day, prednisolone  mg/day) for at least  days before start of study treatment are eligible
Current, chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent\r\n* Note: topical applications (e.g. rash), inhaled sprays (e.g. obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular) are allowed; if a patient stops corticosteroids prior to study participation, a -week washout is required
