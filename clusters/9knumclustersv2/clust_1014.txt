Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of\n             becoming pregnant, unless they were using effective methods of contraception during\n             dosing of study treatment.\n\n             Effective contraception methods included:\n\n               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of\n                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,\n                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of\n                  contraception.\n\n               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without\n                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.\n                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was\n                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n\n               -  Male sterilization (at least  months prior to screening).

In case\n                  of use of oral contraception women would have been stable on the same pill for a\n                  minimum of  months before taking study treatment. Women were considered\n                  post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they had  months of\n                  natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age\n                  appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or had surgical bilateral\n                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks\n                  ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the\n                  woman had been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment was she considered\n                  not of child bearing potential.\n\n         . History of positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test result. Testing was not\n             required. No additional exclusions were applied by the investigator, in order to\n             ensure that the study population was representative of all eligible patients.
