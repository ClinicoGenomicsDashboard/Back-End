Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYP  A) are ineligible
PHASE I: Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYPA) are ineligible

Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A (CYPA) or cytochrome P family , subfamily C, polypeptide  (CYPC) are ineligible\r\n* For patients on intermediate inducers or inhibitors, attempts should be made to switch to an alternative agent or delay enrollment until treatment course with concomitant agent completed; if not possible, patient may be enrolled if it is felt to be in the patients best interest as decided by the investigator\r\n* Weak inhibitors of CYPA or CYPC should be used with caution and attempts made to limit their use or find alternative agents, if possible
Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inducers of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYPA) are ineligible; moderate inducers of CYPA should be used with caution
Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYPA) complex are ineligible
Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYPA) are ineligible; an exception will be made for patients who are on ritonavir-based highly active antiretroviral therapy, in which case the starting dose of sunitinib will be modified; every effort should be made to switch patients taking such agents or substances to other medications
Individuals receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYPA) enzyme(s) are eligible only if principal investigator approves subject enrollment prior to registration; participants who have received a medication or substance listed may be enrolled on study as long as they have discontinued its use at least  hours prior to registration

Receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYP A); \r\n* NOTE: oxidative metabolism of MK- in human liver microsomes is catalyzed primarily by CYPA, although direct glucuronidation also occurs; at least  days washout period is required in patients who were previously taking strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP. A; patients who are currently taking moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP A are encouraged to switch to other medications that do not interact with CYP A

Receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide / (CYPA/)
Refusal or inability to discontinue medications or other substances (eg, foods or dietary supplements) that may affect F SKI- metabolism; notably, as dasatinib metabolism is cytochrome P, family , subfamily A, polypeptide  (CYPA)-dependent, the metabolism of F SKI- may be altered by inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P isoenzyme CYPA; the acceptability of medications and other substances used by the patient will be determined by the study investigators
