Presence of untreated brain metastases; if patients have had previous treatment for the brain metastasis, an MRI or CT scan of the brain must confirm the stabilization of the brain metastasis for more than  months
No evidence of CNS metastasis by MRI or CT of the brain performed within  days of enrollment
Known, untreated brain metastasis. Patients with signs or symptoms of brain metastasis must have a CT or MRI performed within  weeks prior to randomization to specifically exclude the presence of radiographically-detected brain metastases
Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases\r\n* NOTE: Subjects who are symptomatic or have not undergone prior brain imaging must undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within  days prior to registration to exclude brain metastases\r\n* NOTE: A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis at least  weeks prior to study registration, have been off of corticosteroids for >=  weeks, are asymptomatic, and there is no evidence of progression on brain imaging (CT or MRI)
Patients with known brain metastases are eligible only if he/she has been treated for brain metastasis, are asymptomatic after treatment, have a stable CT or MRI of the brain within  days of enrollment and are not receiving corticosteroid therapy to control symptoms from brain metastasis. Only a non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsant (e.g., Keppra) will be permitted for those patients requiring anticonvulsants. (Topical and/or inhaled steroids are allowed.)
No active central nervous system (CNS) metastases; subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to exclude brain metastasis within  days of registration; note: a subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and are asymptomatic
Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases; subjects with neurological symptoms should undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to exclude brain metastasis, at the discretion of the treating physician\r\n* NOTE: A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and are asymptomatic
Subjects with known or history of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease: subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a contrast CT scan or MRI of the brain within  days prior to randomization to exclude active brain metastasis. Imaging of the central nervous system (CNS) is otherwise not required.
The subject has current or previously treated brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease. Brain imaging is required during screening in all subjects to exclude the presence of unequivocal central nervous system disease.
History of or active CNS metastasis (brain, leptomeningeal or cord compression). Brain imaging studies are not required for eligibility if the subject has no neurologic signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis. Subjects with neurological symptoms are recommended to undergo a head CT scan (with or without intravenous contrast) or brain MRI (with or without intravenous contrast) to exclude brain metastasis. If brain imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for CNS disease. Skull bone involvement without neurological impact by prostate cancer is allowed.
Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects must undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain MRI within  days prior to registration for protocol therapy to exclude brain metastases if symptomatic or without prior brain imaging
Patients with known brain metastases; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastases
Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastasis; previously treated brain metastases will be allowed as long as the patient is neurologically stable and is off steroids and anticonvulsants
Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastasis; previously treated brain metastases will be allowed as long as the patient is neurologically stable and is off steroids and anticonvulsants at the time of registration
Presence of untreated brain metastases; if patients have had previous treatment for brain metastasis, an MRI or CT scan of the brain must confirm the stabilization of the brain metastasis for more than  weeks
Patients with brain metastases are allowed onto the study as long as patients have completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and are asymptomatic; subjects with neurological symptoms should undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to exclude brain metastasis, at the discretion of the treating physician
Known brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasis
Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded; head computed tomography (CT) is NOT routinely required prior to enrollment; patients with treated, asymptomatic brain metastasis will be eligible for enrollment
Subject has active central nervous system (CNS) metastases not controlled by prior surgery or radiotherapy (subjects must be off steroids). Subjects with signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis are not eligible unless brain metastases are ruled out by brain MRI/CT.
Known central nervous system (CNS) or brain metastasis that are either symptomatic or untreated; Note: patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastasis\r\n* Note: patients with CNS metastases that have been treated and are stable without symptoms for >=  weeks after completion of treatment are eligible
Known brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasis
No active brain metastases. Patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a head CT scan or brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis within  days prior to registration on protocol therapy. NOTE: A patient with prior brain metastasis are eligible if they have completed their radiation treatment for brain metastasis ? days prior to registration for protocol therapy, are off steroids, and are asymptomatic.
