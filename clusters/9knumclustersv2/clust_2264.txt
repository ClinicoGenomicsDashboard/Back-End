Concurrent use of systemic steroids (within  days of enrollment) will be excluded, except for physiologic doses of systemic steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use; limited doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway disease) must have completed at least  days prior to enrollment; steroid use to prevent intravenous (IV) contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies is allowed at any time prior to enrollment
Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, eye drops or inhaled) steroid use; limited doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway disease or to prevent IV contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed
No systemic steroid or steroid eye drop use within  weeks prior to initiation of experimental therapy; limited doses of systemic steroids to prevent IV contrast, allergic reaction or anaphylaxis (in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed
Evidence of immune dysfunction as listed below:\r\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity\r\n* Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a history of autoimmune disease that might be stimulated by vaccine treatment; however, patients with vitiligo may be enrolled\r\n* Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use; limited doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway disease or to prevent intravenous [IV] contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed
Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic steroids for replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use; limited doses of systemic steroids to prevent intravenous (IV) contrast, allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis (in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed; although topical steroids are allowed, steroid eye-drops are contraindicated
No systemic steroid use within  weeks prior to initiation of experimental therapy; limited doses of systemic steroids to prevent intravenous (IV) contrast, allergic reaction or anaphylaxis (in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed

No systemic steroid or steroid eye drop use within  weeks prior to initiation of experimental therapy; limited doses of systemic steroids to prevent intravenous (IV) contrast, allergic reaction or anaphylaxis (in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed
Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use; limited pharmacologic doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway disease or to prevent intravenous [I.V.] contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed
