Patients who have failed at least one line of a standard treatment, including bendamustine, fludarabine, ibrutinib, or alemtuzumab and require treatment within  years of completion of last treatment regimen or untreated with delp by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) (high-risk) who do not have an allogeneic stem cell transplant option
Hematologic malignancy in complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) detectable by conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), flow cytometry, or molecular testing
Human epidermal growth factor receptor  (HER)-overexpressing breast cancer by local laboratory testing (immunohistochemistry [IHC] + staining or fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] positive)
Patients with non-metastatic, node positive, HER negative breast cancer, confirmed by pathology report, who are in remission and defined as having no evidence of disease (NED); HER negative is defined as\r\n* -+ HER expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) OR\r\n* Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative OR\r\n* HER + and FISH negative
Subjects with invasive breast cancer at least stage IIIA >= N (>  positive nodes) or have recurrent metastatic breast cancer rendered no evidence of disease (NED) by any means that are classic HER- + %, + immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positive or HER- + FISH negative that have completed chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab and have no evidence of disease
HER/neu-expressing tumor (immunohistochemistry [IHC] + and/or amplified fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] >., or N (i+))
History of HER/neu positive cancer (IHC + and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] positive) as assessed by medical record review at screening
Pathologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or primary esophagogastric cancer; HER positive status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) as currently being implemented for patients with esophagogastric cancer; HER overexpression and/or amplification as determined by IHC (+) or FISH (>= .)
Two patients must be HER + by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positive
The cancer must over express HER as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
Cohort : Her-positive (defined as +) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) HER:Chromosome  centromere (CEP) ratio >  biopsy-proven breast cancer
Cohort : Her-positive (defined as +) or FISH HER:CEP ratio >  OR HER-negative ( or +, + and FISH negative) biopsy-proven breast cancer
Histologically confirmed HER+ breast cancer: immunohistochemistry (IHC) + or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplified; by clinical assay on either primary or metastatic tumor
For patients with evidence of minimal residual disease prior to vaccination, assessment of minimal residual disease status by cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) will be followed post vaccination
Tumor HER/neu expression must be determined (as part of standard clinical care) prior to study enrollment; HER may be tested by any Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved HER testing method; if determination is intermediate by immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or another alternate HER test must be performed
The patient is receiving preoperative chemotherapy other than adriamyacin, cyclophosphamide, and a taxane (ACT) in standard or dose-dense fashion; herceptin may be added to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in cases where the tumor is Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor  (Her-)/neu positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
