Active small or large intestine inflammation such as Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis
History of symptomatic autoimmune disease (such as lupus, scleroderma, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis) requiring systemic treatment (for example corticosteroids or immunosuppressants); replacement therapy (for example, thyroxine, insulin) is not considered a systemic treatment
Active rectal diverticulitis, Crohns disease affecting the rectum or ulcerative colitis (non-active diverticulitis and Crohns disease not affecting the rectum are allowed)
History of active autoimmune diseases such as but not limited to Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, Sjogrens syndrome, requiring active immune suppression; patient may have hay fever or controlled asthma
History of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis
CAPMATINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact on drug absorption
CERITINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact on drug absorption
REGORAFENIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact on drug absorption
ENTRECTINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, short gut syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact on drug absorption
History of Crohns disease or Ulcerative colitis
Any active gastrointestinal (GI) impairment which, in the opinion of the investigator, would impair or alter the absorption of ceritinib (e.g., ulcerative colitis, or Crohns disease)
History of (H/o) Crohns disease/ulcerative colitis/scleroderma
Active rectal diverticulitis, Crohns disease, or ulcerative colitis
Any patient with active Crohns disease or active ulcerative colitis
History of Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, or ataxia telangiectasia
Chronic diarrhea > grade , or a diagnosis of Crohns or ulcerative colitis
History of diverticulitis, diverticulosis requiring antibiotic treatment or chronic ulcerative lower gastrointestinal (GI) disease such as Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis or other symptomatic lower GI conditions that might predispose to perforations
Patients must not have active or a history of small or large intestine inflammation such as Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis
Presence of a malabsorption syndrome possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., Crohns disease or chronic pancreatitis)
History of diverticulitis, chronic ulcerative lower GI disease such as Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis, or other symptomatic lower GI conditions that might predispose to perforations
At the time of screening, active peptic ulcer disease or active inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis
Malabsorption syndrome, (prior surgical procedures affecting absorption), or inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) disease (e.g., Crohns, ulcerative colitis) which in the opinion of the study coordinator is likely to limit normal absorption of the drug
Patients with Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis
History of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis
Patients who have malabsorption problems, such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohns disease, bowel surgery such as gastric bypass, and celiac disease
History of diverticulitis, Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis
Have a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohns disease or colitis), colon polyps, or a history of cancer except non-melanoma skin cancer
Ongoing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or colitis (including but not limited to ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, microscopic colitis, etc.)
Known diagnosis of colon heritable cancer syndrome (familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP], hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) or inflammatory bowel disease (Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis)
No previous diagnoses of ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease or irritable bowel disease
