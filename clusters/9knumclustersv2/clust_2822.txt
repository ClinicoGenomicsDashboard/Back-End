Positive hepatitis C serology or active hepatitis B infection; chronic asymptomatic viral hepatitis is allowed
Positive hepatitis B or C serology.
Positive serology for hepatitis B or hepatitis C or known HIV infection
Patient with active Hepatitis B or C determined by serology and/or NAAT.
PART I: Negative serology for hepatitis B and C unless the result is consistent with prior vaccination or prior infection with full recovery
PART II: Negative serology for hepatitis B and C unless the result is consistent with prior vaccination or prior infection with full recovery
Positive serology for HIV or hepatitis C
Positive serology for hepatitis B defined by a positive test for HBsAg
Has a known prior history of viral hepatitis (B or C) as demonstrated by positive serology (presence of antigens) or have an uncontrolled infection requiring treatment
Patients with positive hepatitis serology that is definitive of active disease.
Active hepatitis B or C determined by serology and/or nucleic acid testing (NAT)
Has a prior history of viral hepatitis (B or C) as demonstrated by positive serology (presence of antigens) or have an uncontrolled infection requiring treatment. Participants with a known prior history of hepatitis B or C may be eligible pending agreement with the sponsor.
Positive hepatitis C serology or active hepatitis B infection
Patients with positive serology for hepatitis C are NOT eligible
Negative hepatitis C serology
Known positive serology for hepatitis B (unless due to vaccination or passive immunization due to immunoglobulin therapy)
Known positive serology for hepatitis C (unless due to immunoglobulin therapy)
Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology-positive (or known history of HIV seropositive status) participants are ineligible; hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV serology-positive individuals were excluded from the pivotal pembrolizumab clinical trial in melanoma, so safety of this drug in this setting is unknown
Positive hepatitis C serology or active hepatitis B infection
Patients who have a prior history of viral hepatitis (B or C) as demonstrated by positive serology (presence of antigens) or have an uncontrolled infection requiring treatment are not eligible
Active hepatitis A, B or C infection\r\n* Hepatitis A serology is not required for normal liver function
Known positive hepatitis C serology or active hepatitis B infection  chronic asymptomatic viral hepatitis is allowed
positive hepatitis B and/or C serology.
Positive serology (unless due to vaccination or passive immunization due to Ig therapy) for hepatitis B
Positive serology for hepatitis C based on test at screening.
Positive test results for chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serology)
Positive test results for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody serology testing)
Negative serology for active hepatitis B and C for anakinra arm. Patients with positive serology for hepatitis B might eligible if they are willing to take lamivudine preventive therapy.
Positive test results for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] serology) or positive test result for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody serology testing)
Patient must not have a history of positive hepatitis C serology
Hepatitis B carrier status history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or positive serology; a patient is considered as HBV carrier or to have (had) HBV infection in case of: \r\n* Unimmunized and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or anti-HBs antibody and/or anti- HBc antibody positive,\r\n* Immunized and HBsAG and/or anti-HBc antibody positive\r\n** Important note: for the phase III trial, a patient without a known history of hepatitis B could be randomized in the study if the serology results are not available at the time of the randomization; however, if the serology results are positive or not available at day  (the first day would be due to receive rituximab, if so randomized), the patient must be withdrawn from the study whatever the allocated treatment arm; the data center must be informed immediately; for the phase II trial, the hepatitis B serology results must be available before registration; in each case indicating a carrier status or history for hepatitis B infection, the patients must not receive rituximab, and therefore must not be included in the rituximab trials on any treatment arm; in case of high-risk patients, the recommendation is to treat these patients with the standard LMB regimen corresponding to the patient prognostic group; in the case of PMLBL the physician is left to choose the most appropriate therapy
A positive hepatitis C serology is an exclusion criterion
Hepatitis B carrier status history of HBV or positive serology.
Positive serology for Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B (HBV)-positive serology and is receiving interferon therapy or has liver function test results outside the parameters of study inclusion criteria. Other antiviral therapies are permitted if at a stable dose for at least  weeks.
Positive serology (unless due to vaccination or passive immunization due to Ig therapy) for hepatitis B
Positive serology for hepatitis C based on test at screening.
Positive hepatitis serology
Positive hepatitis C serology
Patient with active Hepatitis B or C determined by serology and/or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)
