Patients must have pathologically/histologically confirmed tumor of non-small cell histology
Predominant non-squamous histology (patients with NSCLC not otherwise specified [NOS] are eligible); mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type; if small cell elements are present the patient is ineligible
Pure small cell or other variant (non-adenocarcinoma) prostate cancer histology for which treatment with abiraterone would not be considered appropriate
Subjects with poorly differentiated or small cell carcinoma histology
Histologically confirmed prostate cancer (mixed histology is acceptable, with the exception of the small cell pure phenotype, which is be excluded)
Mixed small-cell lung cancer and sarcomatoid variant NSCLC histology
Has any evidence of small cell histology, or combined small cell and non-small cell histology, in original tumor biopsy or in screening biopsy performed since progression.
Histologically confirmed prostate cancer (mixed histology is acceptable, with the exception of the small cell pure phenotype, which is be excluded
All subjects must have a diagnosis of ALL of either B-cell, T-cell, or mixed (i.e., B/T lineage)
Primary tumors of radiosensitive histology (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, small cell carcinoma, germ cell tumors), as conventional radiation is likely to be effective in such cases
Any component of small cell histology
Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma histology at the time of initial diagnosis.\r\na) Mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type; (Note: If small cell elements are present the patient is ineligible)\r\nb) Known mutational status of KRAS and BRAF oncogenes.\r\nc) For patients in whom mutational testing result is unknown or unavailable from a prior test, KRAS and BRAF testing will be performed (at a CLIA-certified laboratory) using an archived or fresh biopsy as per Standard of Care, prior to enrollment.
Small cell or other variant (non-adenocarcinoma) prostate cancer histology, unless there is evidence that the tumor expresses PAP
Non-small cell lung cancer of squamous histology
Primary lesion with radiosensitive histology that includes the following: small cell carcinoma, germ cell tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma
Patients with biopsy-proven small cell or sarcomatoid histology
Predominantly squamous cell histology NSCLC. Mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type; if small cell elements are present, the participant is ineligible.
Patients with mixed small cell and non-small cell histologies
Histologic proof of non-small cell histology (adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous, large cell carcinoma, squamous carcinoma, non-lobar and non-diffuse bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer not otherwise specified [NOS]) within  weeks of registration; note: mixed small cell and non-small cell histologies are not eligible for this study
Tumors of adenocarcinoma, melanoma, small cell and basal cell histology are excluded
Small cell or other (non-adenocarcinoma) variant prostate cancer histology
Have mixed small cell and non-small cell histologic features.
Patients with a small cell component in their histology are excluded
Mixed small cell and non-small cell lung cancer histology.
Adenocarcinoma histology (including poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], favor adenocarcinoma) of any variant, including adenosquamous histology
Mixed small cell and non-small cell lung cancer histology
Small cell or other variant prostate cancer histology
Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer; mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in which case the patient is ineligible; cytologic or histologic elements can be established on metastatic tumor aspirate or biopsy; sputum cytology alone is not sufficient
Mixed, non-small cell and small cell tumors or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas with a predominant squamous component
Small cell or other variant prostate cancer histology
Patients with tumors that have a component of small cell carcinoma
Mixed histology or undifferentiated small cell carcinoma, any stage
Patients must have pathologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer, including squamous, non-squamous, mixed histology, or large cell
Histologically or cytologically documented, advanced, mixed non-small cell and small cell tumors or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas
Patients with variant histologies (e.g., ductal or small cell carcinoma)
Mixed small cell and NSCLC histology
Patients must have histologically or cytologically proven primary non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma in situ, mixed histology with < % squamous or unspecified); patients with tumors having squamous cell components >= % are not eligible; disease must be stage IV
Squamous, small cell, carcinoid, adenosquamous, large-cell neuroendocrine, or mixed histology containing small-cell or squamous-cell NSCLC
Mixed, non-small cell and small cell tumors or mixed adenosquamous carcinomas with a predominant squamous component
Patients who have mixed tumors with small-cell elements are ineligible
Histologically or cytologically-proven non squamous cell NSCLC; mixed histology with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) component not allowed
Patients with a histology of lymphoma, myeloma and small cell lung cancer histologies
Has any evidence of small cell histology, or combined small cell and non-small cell histology, in original tumor biopsy or in Screening biopsy performed after progression
Cancer Registry cases for diseases other than colon or rectal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (squamous or adenocarcinoma histology)
