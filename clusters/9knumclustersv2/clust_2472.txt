STEP I: Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or asymptomatic multiple myeloma are not eligible
Subjects with only plasmacytomas, plasma cell leukemia, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), non-secretory myeloma or primarily amyloidosis.
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma only
Subjects with second malignancies requiring active systemic therapy are excluded; subjects with second malignancies not requiring active systemic therapy or pre-malignant conditions such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) may be eligible
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia, or asymptomatic (smoldering) myeloma
Patient has smoldering multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).
Patients with stage I or smoldering myeloma, isolated plasmacytoma, or benign monoclonal gammopathy are not eligible
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma
Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are not eligible
Participant has a diagnosis of primary amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (presence of serum M-protein < g/dL; absence of lytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency related to the M-protein), or smoldering multiple myeloma (asymptomatic multiple myeloma with absence of related organ or tissue impairment end organ damage)
Diagnosis of primary amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering multiple myeloma, Waldenstrm's disease, or other conditions in which IgM M-protein is present in the absence of a clonal plasma cell infiltration with lytic bone lesions
Subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), primary amyloidosis, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or POEMS syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with poly neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes)
Diagnosed with smoldering MM, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, plasma cell leukemia, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome or amyloidosis
Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational; prior therapy with bisphosphonate is allowed; prior radiation therapy to a solitary plasmacytoma is allowed; prior clinical trials or therapy for smoldering MM or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are allowed but should be discussed with the principal investigator
Smoldering myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), or plasma cell leukemia
Participant has a diagnosis of primary amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, or smoldering multiple myeloma
Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or smoldering myeloma
hyperviscosity syndrome due to monoclonal gammopathy
Solitary bone or extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), primary amyloidosis, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, POEMS syndrome or active plasma cell leukemia
Diagnosis of any monoclonal gammopathy: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), asymptomatic / active multiple myeloma, asymptomatic / active Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM)
POEMS (Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) syndrome, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, smoldering myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, amyloidosis, Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia, or IgM myeloma.
