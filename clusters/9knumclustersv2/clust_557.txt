DONOR: Donors >=  years of age must be the same individual whose cells were used as the source for the patients original stem cell transplant
Marrow is the preferred source of stem cells from the HLA-haploidentical donor, however, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) could be used as stem cell source, after clearance with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) principal investigator, in the case of difficulties or contraindications to bone marrow harvest from the donor
DONOR: Marrow is the preferred source of stem cells from the HLA-haploidentical donor, however PBMC could be used as stem cell source, after clearance with the FHCRC principal investigator, in the case of difficulties or contraindications to bone marrow harvest from the donor

Donor stem cell source can be either peripheral blood or bone marrow
Cord blood as a donor source is not acceptable
Have undergone first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from any donor source using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood for hematologic malignancies. Recipients of nonmyeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regimens are eligible.
HLA Matched Related Donor: G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) only will be permitted as a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source on this protocol

Patients receiving bone marrow or umbilical cord blood as a stem cell source may also be considered for enrollment with acknowledgement that if there is insufficient product available for DLI, the patient will receive azacitidine without DLI per standard-risk treatment
DONOR: Meets standard institutional criteria for GCSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donation
Use of cord blood as the source of hematopoietic cells is not allowed.

DONOR: Only filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source on this protocol
DONOR: Marrow will be the only allowed hematopoietic stem cell source
