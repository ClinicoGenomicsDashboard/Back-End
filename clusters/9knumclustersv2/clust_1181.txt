Patients must not have documented iron deficiency; all patients must have documented marrow iron stores; if marrow iron stain is not available, the transferrin saturation must be > % or a serum ferritin >  ng/mL

Subjects must have liver iron value of <  mg/g/dry weight; iron quantitation may be performed by imaging such as T*magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or by biopsy
PART I: History of iron overload or hemochromatosis
PART II: History of iron overload or hemochromatosis
Any other evidence of severe iron overload that, in the Investigator's opinion, warrants exclusion.
DONOR: Anemia (Hb <  gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets < , per ul); however, potential donors with Hb levels <  gm/dl that is due to iron deficiency will be eligible as long as the donor is initiated on iron replacement therapy and the case is individually approved by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Blood Bank
Patients requiring iron supplementation will be excluded
Evidence of iron deficiency anemia including, hemoglobin (Hgb) <  g/dL, but >  g/dL; and transferrin saturation (TSAT) < %

Subjects with known hypersensitivity and allergy to iron
