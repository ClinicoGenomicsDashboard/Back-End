The urine protein: creatinine ratio (UPCR) is derived as follows: protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL); patients must have a UPCR < . to allow participation in the study
Urinary protein =< + obtained =< days prior to randomization\r\n* Patients discovered to have >= + proteinuria must have a spot urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) < .
If UPCR ratio >= , collection of -hour urine measurement of urine protein is recommended

Patients with greater than + proteinuria on a urine dipstick or equivalent routine laboratory analysis will require further testing with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR); UPCR must be calculated as follows: UPCR = protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL); if the UPCR >=  then the patient will not be eligible for study entry; however, if urinalysis or equivalent routine laboratory analysis shows no protein, then UPC testing is not required
Patients with clinically significant proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by urine protein:creatinine (UPCR) ratio >/= . at screening. The UPCR has been found to correlate directly with the amount of protein excreted in a  hour urine collection. Specifically, a UPCR of . is equivalent to . gram of protein in a  hour urine collection. Obtain at least  ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a  hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine levels [separate requests].

Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 
Urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) >  urinalysis or total urine protein >  mg/ hours (h)

Urine protein should be screened by urinalysis for urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR); for UPCR > , a -hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be <  mg
Patients with clinically significant proteinuria; urine protein should be screened by urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR); patients must have a UPCR < . to allow participation in the study
