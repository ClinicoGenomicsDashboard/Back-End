Willing to undergo core needle or incisional biopsy to obtain fresh tumor tissue specimens
Patients must have tumor block or slides available for testing, and tumor must be glucocorticoid receptor positive (defined as GR >= % moderate to strong staining by central lab); a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical or core needle biopsy obtained from the primary tumor or from a metastasis and containing viable tumor tissue is required for this evaluation; fine needle aspirates or other alternative cytology samples are not acceptable
Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (blocks are preferred) or at least  unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, for central testing of tumor PD-L expression a) Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content. Fine needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone metastases, and lavage samples are not acceptable.

The subject must be expected to have an adequate amount of tumor burden to yield - pre-operative research core biopsy (-gauge needle) specimens or the equivalent amount of tissue (- mm punch biopsy), in addition, to the tissue required for diagnostic purposes
Patients must have adequate tumor tissue available for PD-L testing; adequate tumor tissue is defined as:\r\n* For core-needle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should be submitted for evaluation if feasible; acceptable samples include core-needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum of three cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions; samples collected from fine-needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone metastases without a soft tissue component, and lavage are not acceptable\r\n* For pre-treatment archival tissue, representative urothelial carcinoma formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens (tumor blocks or  unstained slides) must be provided; patients with <  slides may be enrolled after discussion with the MSK principal investigator\r\n* Primary or metastatic specimens (with the exception of bone because it is not evaluable for PD-L expression) may be submitted
Representative tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or at least  unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, requested at any time prior to study entry; only tissue from core needle, punch, or excisional biopsy sample collection will be accepted; fine-needle aspiration, brushing, and lavage samples are not acceptable; for all biopsy types, submitted blocks should have sufficient tissue to generate at least  sections, and tissue for which the pathology report specifies that the overall tumor content is low (e.g., sparse or scant) is not acceptable; tissue from separate time points (such as time of initial diagnosis and time of metastatic diagnosis) or from the multiple metastatic tumors may also be collected for a given patient, on the basis of availability
If archival tissue is either insufficient or unavailable, the patient may still be eligible if the patient can provide at least five unstained, serial slides or is willing to consent to and undergo a pre-treatment core or excisional biopsy sample collection of the tumor; fine-needle aspiration, brushing, and lavage samples are not acceptable
Immunohistochemical staining for p must be performed on tissue, and this tissue must be submitted for central review; fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy specimens may be used as the sole diagnostic tissue if formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cell block material is available for p immunohistochemistry; FNA specimens prepared with adequate p testing in this manner are acceptable to submit for central review; if the p preparation is not adequate, additional specimens will be required to establish p status; centers are encouraged to contact the pathology chairs for clarification
A paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimen from the initial diagnostic biopsy has been located and ready to ship to the Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Laboratory following pre-registration; Note: excisional tumor biopsy is preferred; core needle biopsies will be considered adequate if there is enough tissue for the mandatory central pathology review immunohistochemistry and Genomics Education Partnership (GEP); submission of a tumor block is preferred, but if unavailable submit alternative materials
For participants who will undergo serial biopsy in dose-escalation cohort, baseline tumor tissue samples should be of core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue or organs or excisional or punch biopsies for cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions (>/= millimeter [mm] in diameter amenable to serial biopsy)
If an archived tumor block exists, then either the block or at least  unstained slides from the block should be submitted. Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content, i.e. at least  viable tumor cells and intact tissue architecture. Fine needle aspiration, brushing,and lavage samples are not acceptable. If the block is tissue from a core-needle biopsy, then the block should contain tissue from at least three cores to be sufficient for evaluation.
Patients who do not have existing (archived) tissue specimens meeting eligibility requirements may undergo a biopsy during the screening period. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum of three cores) or excisional, or forceps biopsies for endobronchial or nodal lesions. The tissue should be fixed in formalin and embedded on site and sent as a block.

Participant has provided a formalin fixed tumor tissue sample from a biopsy of a tumor lesion either at the time of or after the diagnosis of metastatic disease has been made and from a site not previously irradiated to assess for a protein known as Programmed death-ligand ( PD-L) status. Fine needle aspirates, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or cell blocks are not acceptable. Needle or excisional biopsies, or resected tissue is required. Archival tissue may be acceptable. Submission of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue sample blocks are preferred; if submitting unstained slides, the slides should be freshly cut and submitted to the testing laboratory within  days from site slide sectioning date otherwise a new specimen will be requested.
