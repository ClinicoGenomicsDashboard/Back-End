Total protein < g/L or substitution dependency
Worsening urinary paraproteinemia will be considered in the context of International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) disease response criteria on a monthly basis; any patient with urinary protein (otherwise unrelated to urinary myeloma associated monoclonal [M]-protein) with excretion > . g/day will be considered to have developed nephrotic-range proteinuria, and will be taken off study
Within  days prior to cycle  day  of treatment: Urinary albumin excretion < . g/ hours (as estimated by urine protein-creatinine ratio)
Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (CRP >  mg/L) probably or definitely attributable to KSHV-MCD
Urinary protein excretion =<  mg/day
Presence of serum and/or urinary monoclonal protein
Patients must not have a known thrombophilic condition (i.e. protein S, protein C or antithrombin III deficiency, Factor V Leiden, Factor II GA mutation, homocysteinemia or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome); testing is not required in patients without thrombophilic history
Urinary protein is <+.
Have persistent + protein by urinalysis (patients with + proteinuria that have a spot protein:creatinine ratio of less than . may be enrolled) or a history of nephrotic syndrome.
Prior treatment with TRC or axitinib or any agent targeting the endoglin pathway (including a fusion protein that binds bone morphogenic protein)

Have persistent + protein by urinalysis (patients with + proteinuria that have a spot protein:creatinine ratio of less than . may be enrolled) or a history of nephrotic syndrome.
Urinary M-protein excretion at least  mg/ hours; or
Subjects must have a C-reactive protein (CRP) >  mg/L
C-reactive protein (CRP) must be >=  mg/l in the absence of any other more likely cause of increased CRP like an infection or an autoimmune disorder
Total protein within  x ULN
Patient must not have a known thrombophilic condition (i.e. protein S, protein C or antithrombin III deficiency, Factor V Leiden, Factor II GA mutation, homocysteinemia, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome); testing is not required in patients without a thrombophilic history
Urinary M-protein excretion at least  mg/ hours; or
C-reactive protein >  mg/L
Known protein C, protein S, or anti-thrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic disorders
