Patients who have the following risk factors are considered to be at increased risk for cardiac toxicity and must have documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram greater than institutions lower limit of normal (or % if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines) obtained within  months\r\n* Prior treatment with anthracyclines\r\n* Prior treatment with trastuzumab\r\n* A New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of II controlled with treatment\r\n* Prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart.\r\n* History of myocardial infarction within  months (patients with history of myocardial infarction within  months are excluded)
Patients must have documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram greater than institutions lower limit of normal (or % if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines) obtained within  months prior to registration if they have any of the following risk factors for cardiac toxicities:\r\n* A New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of II controlled with treatment \r\n* Prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart\r\n* History of myocardial infarction within  months prior to registration\r\n* Prior treatment with anthracyclines\r\n* Prior treatment with trastuzumab\r\n* Prior history of other significant impaired cardiac function
Patients who have the following risk factors are considered to be at increased risk for cardiac toxicities, and must have documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram greater than institutions lower limit of normal (or % if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines) obtained within  months\r\n* Prior treatment with anthracyclines\r\n* Prior treatment with trastuzumab\r\n* A New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of II controlled with treatment\r\n* Prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart\r\n* History of myocardial infarction within  months (patients with history of myocardial infarction within  months are excluded from the study)
Patients who have the following risk factors are considered to be at increased risk for cardiac toxicities and may be enrolled only with increased monitoring: i) prior treatment with anthracyclines; ii) prior treatment with trastuzumab; iii) a New York Heart Association classification of II controlled with treatment; iv) prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart
If cardiac function assessment is clinically indicated or performed: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than normal per institutional guidelines, or < %, if threshold for normal not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines\r\n* Patients with the following risk factors should have a baseline cardiac function assessment:\r\n** Prior treatment with anthracyclines\r\n** Prior treatment with trastuzumab\r\n** Prior central thoracic radiation therapy (RT), including RT to the heart\r\n** History of myocardial infarction within  to  months (patients with history of myocardial infarction within  months are excluded from the study)\r\n** Prior history of impaired cardiac function
