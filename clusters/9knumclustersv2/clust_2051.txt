Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.
Females: \r\n* Of childbearing potential must: \r\n** Not be nursing\r\n** Have a negative serum pregnancy test documented within  hours prior to administration of F FSPG PET/CT\r\n* Not of childbearing potential must be: \r\n** Physiologically postmenopausal (cessation of menses for more than  year)\r\n** Surgically sterile (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy)
Pregnant or lactating patients will be excluded, as will females of childbearing potential who refuse to undergo a serum or urinary beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test the day of either the F-FSPG or the F-FDG PET/CT scans in accordance with the standard policy of the Medical Imaging Service at our facility; women who have experienced  consecutive months of amenorrhea, have reached at least  years of age, or have had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy documented in their medical records are considered not to be of childbearing potential for the purposes of this protocol
Not currently pregnant or nursing: Subject must be surgically sterile (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy), post-menopausal (cessation of menses for more than  year), non-lactating, or of childbearing potential for whom a urine pregnancy test (with the test performed within the  hour period immediately prior to administration of Zr-trastuzumab) is negative
