Patients with evidence of active brain metastases, or active leptomeningeal disease are ineligible; patients with a history of brain metastases must have completed treatment (i.e. surgery or radiation) prior to enrollment
Patients with metastases
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Subjects with known symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
No active intracranial metastases
Participants must not have active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, are not allowed; subjects with previously treated brain metastases will be allowed if the brain metastases have been stable without steroid treatment for at least  weeks (radiotherapy or surgery)
Patients are excluded if they have active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases; subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been treated and there is no imaging evidence of progression for  days after treatment is complete and within  days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration
Patients may have metastases, with newly identified peripheral metastases
Primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or CNS metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, are not allowed; subjects with previously treated brain metastases will be allowed if the brain metastases have been stable for at least  months following prior treatment (radiotherapy or surgery)
Known active brain or leptomeningeal metastases (defined as symptomatic metastases) or continued requirement for glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases; treated, asymptomatic metastases are permitted provided the patient has been off steroids for at least  weeks prior to day  of study drug
Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial; patients with other extrapleural metastases are included in this study
Patients with cerebral metastases
Patients with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Patients are excluded if they have active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases; subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for  days prior to initiation of treatment
Patients are excluded if they have active, symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases; subjects with known brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for four weeks (after treatment is complete and within  days prior to study drug administration)
Patients with cerebral metastases
Subjects must not have clinically active cerebral metastases.
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are not allowed.
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Any brain metastases including leptomeningeal metastases, are excluded, even if treated and stable.
Subjects with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Documented or symptomatic brain metastases and/or central nervous system metastases or leptomeningeal disease
Brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease or bone metastases
Clinically active cerebral metastases.
Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, are not allowed; subjects with previously treated brain metastases will be allowed if the brain metastases have been stable without steroid treatment for at least  weeks following prior treatment (radiotherapy or surgery)
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are not allowed
Leptomeningeal metastases or brain metastases except as for Inclusion Criterion #.
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Active metastases.
Active central nervous system metastases. Patients with a history of brain metastases may be eligible, provided they have been definitively treated and are clinically stable, after discussion with sponsor. Treated or untreated leptomeningeal disease is not permitted.
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases (carcinomatous meningitis); subjects with brain metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no evidence of progression for at least  weeks after treatment is complete and corticosteroid dose is stable (and equivalent dose of <  mg prednisone) for at least  weeks
Active metastases.
Subjects with leptomeningeal metastases may or may not have brain metastases. When brain metastases are present, they do not need to have progressed after radiation therapy
Active brain metastases (untreated brain metastases or growth on imaging as defined below) or leptomeningeal disease are not allowed; subjects with brain metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no MRI (or CT if MRI contraindicated) evidence of progression for at least  weeks after treatment for these metastases is complete and within  days prior to first study treatment
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases are not allowed; subjects with previously treated brain metastases will be allowed if the brain metastases have been treated, toxicities have resolved to grade  or baseline and steroids are no longer required; leptomeningeal metastases are not allowed
For lung metastases, no more than  metastases treated in one setting
Subjects with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Has active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.
