Recipients with ALL in CR must have one of the following:\r\n* Adverse cytogenetics or residual disease detectable by flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, FISH, or PCR; adverse cytogenetics in ALL are defined as translocations involving t(;), t(;), t(;), q, t(;) or bcr-abl rearrangement or complex cytogenetic abnormalities\r\n* Primary induction failure, defined as failure to achieve CR with primary induction chemotherapy
Refractory B-ALL, defined by not having achieved a CR or CRi after two attempts at remission induction using standard regimens, or
Relapse after going into remission from re-induction for the first or subsequent relapse (ie: nd , rd, threlapse), OR
Refractory disease after first or greater relapse and a re-induction attempt, OR
Failing to go into remission from original diagnosis after  previous induction attempts.
Patients to be enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of this study must have T-cell ALL or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) in first relapse or must have failed primary induction chemotherapy (ie, never attained a complete remission following an initial course of standard therapy for T-ALL or T-LL). Patients to be enrolled in the cohort expansion portion of this study (ie, those treated at the recommended phase  dose) must have T-cell ALL in first relapse or must have failed primary induction chemotherapy (ie, never attained a complete remission following an initial course of standard therapy for T-ALL). T-LL patients are not eligible for the cohort expansion phase.
Anti-neoplastic treatment less than  days prior to enrollment, with the exceptions of hydroxyurea or, in the case of a patient with primary refractory AML, prior induction chemotherapy
A confirmed baseline diagnosis of AML by the revised guidelines of the International Working Group for AML including newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory disease\r\n*Newly diagnosed: \r\n** Age  years and older \r\n** - years old and unfit for conventional chemotherapy\r\n* Relapsed disease: \r\n** Age  years and older any time following the first relapse, if the patient is not considered candidate for or is not interested in salvage chemotherapy\r\n** Age - years who have relapsed less than  months following achievement of a complete remission (defined as duration of remission from the time of documentation of complete morphologic remission to the time of documentation of relapse)\r\n* Refractory disease: \r\n** Age - years who have failed at least two lines of conventional chemotherapy (one induction and one salvage therapy); examples include: \r\n*** Patient achieves a complete remission and receives (or does not receive) consolidation therapy, but relapses later; this patient will be eligible only if s/he fails at least one salvage therapy following relapse\r\n*** Patient demonstrates residual leukemia on post-induction day  bone marrow and receives salvage therapy; this patient will be eligible only if s/he fails the salvage therapy\r\n*** Patient demonstrates reasonable response on post-induction day  bone marrow (or the bone marrow is not performed), but the follow-up bone marrow shows residual disease; this patient will be eligible only if s/he fails at least one salvage therapy\r\n** Age  and older who have failed at least one line of conventional chemotherapy, or treatment with hypomethylating agent (in the setting of poor-risk/complex karyotype) and is not considered candidate for or is not interested in salvage chemotherapy; FltITD +ve disease is not considered responsive to hypomethylating agent\r\n* Patients age  years and older with relapse in the form of AML after stem cell transplant will be eligible, even if they were transplanted for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)
Chemotherapy refractory acute leukemia (AL) will be defined by not in achieving a hematological remission after two consecutive standard courses of induction therapy
Part specific requirements: eligible to receive induction; achieved CR/CRi with standard induction and eligible to receive consolidation; in CR with documented blood count recovery for maintenance
AML relapsed or refractory to at least one attempt at induction or subjects not candidates for aggressive induction regimens
Participants with Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma must meet one of the following criteria:\r\n* Relapsing disease in nd or greater relapse and measurable disease, or\r\n* Refractory disease failing to achieve complete response (CR) with >=  induction or re-induction attempts
Patients with AML must have had at least  prior therapeutic attempts including frontline induction.
Subjects who are refractory* or who have relapsed** following first line AML therapy with cytarabine/anthracycline based chemotherapy, with or without a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. *Refractory to induction therapy is defined as never achieving CR, CRi or CRp (according to International Working Group criteria) after one line of intensive regimen for AML (re-induction, consolidation and/or transplant allowed) including at least one cytarabine containing induction block with a total dose no less than mg/m per cycle and  days of an anthracycline with or without a TKI. or **First relapse is defined as untreated hematologic relapse (according to International Working Group criteria) after one line of intensive regimen for AML (re-induction, consolidation and/or transplant allowed) including at least one cytarabine containing induction block with a total dose no less than mg/m per cycle and  days of an anthracycline with or without a TKI that induced a CR/CRi/CRp. Subjects are allowed to receive induction, consolidation, transplant and/or maintenance prior to achieving their first CR/CRi/CRp.
Patients with relapsed or refractory AML; patients must have failed at least one prior induction regimen for AML; the maximum number of prior lines of induction is 
Either achieved complete remission (greater than  weeks in duration) with initial induction/consolidation and have experienced relapse of disease or declined treatment with high-dose induction/consolidation
Patients with WHO-defined AML,  years of age or older, who are unlikely to benefit from standard induction therapy, defined as having at least  of the following:
Patients may be registered for consolidation provided that they were eligible for the initial induction/re-induction registration and satisfy the following additional criteria:\r\n* Patients must have achieved morphologic remission (complete remission [CR] or complete remission with incomplete blood count recover [CRi]) after completion of induction or re-induction therapy; patient must remain in remission until beginning consolidation and this must be documented by bone marrow and peripheral blood examination within  days prior to registration to Step \r\n* All non-hematologic treatment related toxicities that are deemed clinically significant by the treating physician must have resolved to =< grade \r\n* Patients must not have received allogeneic stem cell transplant
The patient has adverse risk disease or AML for which there is otherwise a substantial risk of relapse, which includes but is not limited to: adverse karyotype, FLT internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, history of antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD), therapy-related AML, history of requiring more than  cycle of intensive induction chemotherapy to achieve first remission, and/or presence of persistent MRD (detected by cytogenetics, molecular markers, or flow cytometry) at any point after the initial induction cycle.
Patient must be either primary refractory to one frontline induction therapy or relapsed after one frontline induction therapy; patients who do not achieve complete remission after induction therapy are also eligible
Refractory disease is defined by the failure to obtain a complete remission (CR) with a HDAC-containing or a standard induction regimen. Patients who require two cycles of induction therapy to attain a first CR are not considered to have refractory disease.
Refractory patients:\r\n* Patients must have received at least two attempts at remission induction, which may consist of up to two different therapy courses; Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML de novo therapy including induction I and induction II is one remission attempt
Patients with multiple myeloma who have not achieved a complete remission (CR) following at least  cycles of induction therapy
MDS  may have achieved CR through either hypomethylating agent therapy, induction chemotherapy, or other therapy
