Subjects with recent significant or unexplained weight loss that the investigator feels may pose an unacceptable risk for enrollment; candidates who are overweight and have lost weight intentionally via diet or exercise should not be excluded, for instance

Serious/uncontrolled medical condition, at the discretion of the protocol chair/designee, likely to hinder accurate measurement of weight, including any condition: for which weight loss is contraindicated, which would likely cause weight loss, or which would affect adipokine and inflammatory markers (e.g., other active malignancy, end stage renal disease [ESRD] on dialysis, cirrhosis, autoimmune disease, adrenal disease, and history of bariatric surgery)
Currently enrolled or planning to enroll in a weight loss program (e.g., Innergy, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, and Medifast); participants also agree not to enroll in such a program for the duration of study participation (regardless of randomization)
Patients that have experienced an involuntary weight loss of more than % of their body weight in the  months preceding study entry
Patient's nutritional and general physical condition must be considered compatible with the proposed radiotherapeutic treatment (cannot have unintentional and/or surgically unrelated weight loss > % in the preceding  months); this assessment is a standard of care assessment for this patient population; this requirement can be waived by the investigator if the subject has an identifiable procedure which is the immediate and sole cause for the weight loss without an underlying pathological cause; an example of a situation like this would be if a participant is found to need a tonsillectomy during the pretreatment evaluations; its obvious that this scenario would be a non-pathological reason for such a weight loss; the Principal Investigator (PI) will only have this ability to waive this criterion if and only if he can substantiate and document that the weight loss does not have a pathological etiology and will correct itself within a reasonable and acceptable period of time
