Persistent uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > mmHg/ diastolic > mmHg Exclusion Criteria Part D
Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (>= / mmHg) are NOT eligible for participation
Patients with uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (>  mmHg systolic or >  mmHg diastolic for >  weeks) despite standard medical management
Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (> / mmHg) are NOT eligible for participation
Uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension (>  mmHg systolic or >  mmHg diastolic for >  weeks) despite standard medical management
Uncontrolled hypertension (> / mmHg)
Hypertension that is not controlled by standard medication (to / mmHg or below),
The patient has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension (>  mmHg systolic or >  mmHg diastolic) at the time of enrollment
Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or hypertension (e.g., systolic >  mmHg or diastolic >  mmHg)
Patients who have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained systolic blood pressure >=  mmHg or diastolic >=  mmHg)
Patients with diagnosed uncontrolled hypertension (> / mmHg) are to be excluded
Uncontrolled arterial hypertension defined by blood pressure >  mmHg systolic and/or  mmHg diastolic at rest (average  consecutive readings at least  minutes apart) despite appropriate medical therapy
The patient has uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (>  mmHg systolic or >  mmHg diastolic for >  weeks) despite standard medical management
Patients who have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained systolic blood pressure >=  mmHg or diastolic >=  mmHg)
Patients who have uncontrolled hypertension (systolic >  mmHg and/or diastolic >  mmHg); it is permissible to start treatment for hypertension prior to randomization
Uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (>  mmHg systolic or >  mmHg diastolic for >  weeks) despite standard medical management
Hypertension that is not controlled by standard medication (to / mmHg or below)
Uncontrolled hypertension (> / mmHg)
Patients who have uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (>  mmHg systolic or >  mmHg diastolic for >  weeks) despite standard medical management
Uncontrolled arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure >  mmHg or diastolic >  mmHg) despite appropriate medical therapy
Have uncontrolled hypertension, as defined in CTCAE Version ., prior to initiating study treatment, despite antihypertensive intervention. CTCAE Version . defines uncontrolled hypertension as Grade > hypertension; clinically, the participant continues to experience elevated blood pressure (systolic > millimeters of mercury [mmHg] and/or diastolic > mmHg) despite medications.
Patients who have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained systolic blood pressure >=  mmHg or diastolic >=  mmHg)
Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [sBP] >  mmHg and/or diastolic BP >  mmHg, found on two consecutive measurements separated by a one week period of time despite adequate medical support)
Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (>= / mmHg) are NOT eligible for participation
Significant uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension defined as: Pulmonary artery peak systolic pressure >  mmHg by echocardiogram, or pulmonary artery peak systolic pressure - mmHg by echocardiogram and mean pulmonary artery pressure by right heart catheterization exceeding  mmHg at rest (or  mmHg with exercise); or NYHA/World Health Organization (WHO), Class III or IV
Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic greater than  and diastolic greater than 
. Uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic ?  mmHg) or hypotension (systolic ?  mmHg).
Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as SBP ?  mmHg and/or DBP ?  mmHg with optimized anti-hypertensive therapy
Known history of malignant hypertension (severe hypertension >/ mmHg with end organ involvement.
Uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic greater to or equal to  mmHg) or hypotension (systolic less than or equal to  mmHg)
Patients who have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained systolic blood pressure >=  mmHg or diastolic >=  mmHg)
Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > , diastolic > ) despite antihypertensive therapy
No uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure =<  millimeters of mercury [mmHg] or diastolic =<  mmHg); patients with hypertension must be adequately controlled with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy or diet
Severe untreated resting arterial hypertension (>  mmHg systolic, >  mmHg diastolic) at the time of enrollment
Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as  consecutive readings over the past year of over  systolic, and over  diastolic)
Uncontrolled arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure >  mmHg, diastolic >  mmHg)
Uncontrolled severe hypertension (systolic > mmHg or diastolic >  mmHg)
Subjects who have diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension are not eligible; NOTE: for the purposes of this study, uncontrolled will be defined as diastolic pressure over  mmHg
Uncontrolled hypertension (mmHg >  systolic or >  diastolic)
