Clinically significant third-space fluid accumulation
Presence of third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage
Presence of third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage; for patients who develop or have baseline clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions (on the basis of symptoms or clinical examination) before or during initiation of pemetrexed therapy, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to dosing; however, if, in the investigator's opinion, the effusion represents progression of disease, the patient should be discontinued from study therapy
Uncontrolled effusion e.g., presence of third space fluid that, in the opinion of the investigator, cannot be successfully controlled by drainage\r\n* Note: Patients with small effusions remaining after pleurodesis are eligible; determination of eligibility based on pleural size will be determined by the principal investigator
Presence of third space fluid that cannot be controlled by drainage\r\n* For patients who develop or have baseline clinically significant pleural effusions before or during initiation of pemetrexed therapy; consideration should be given to drain the effusion prior to chemotherapy administration
Clinically detectable (by physical exam) third?space fluid collections (e.g. ascites or pleural effusion) that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry
Presence of third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage
Clinically significant third-space fluid accumulation
Presence of significant third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage
Pemetrexed arms only: presence of third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage
Clinically significant third-space fluid collections (e.g. ascites or pleural effusion) that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry
Presence of detectable (by physical exam) third-space fluid collections
The participant has clinically significant third-space fluid collections, for example, ascites or pleural effusions that cannot be controlled by drainage or other procedures prior to study entry.
