No invasive tumors within the last  years unless confined to an organ (e.g. prostate or thyroid cancer) and treated with curative therapy (e.g. surgery and/or radiation); please note, there must be no evidence of the prior malignancy using standard criteria to evaluate the specific prior malignancy
Prior invasive malignancy of other histology currently requiring treatment
Invasive malignancy or history of invasive malignancy other than disease under study: any other invasive malignancy from which the subject has been disease-free for more than  years and, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK Medical Monitor, will not affect the evaluation of the effects of this clinical trial treatment on currently targeted malignancy, can be included in this clinical trial; Curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer and any carcinoma-in-situ.
Patients with prior invasive malignancy within two years of enrollment are excluded
Other active, invasive malignancy requiring ongoing therapy or expected to require systemic therapy
Invasive malignancy or history of invasive malignancy other than disease under study within the last two years except: Any other invasive malignancy for which the subject was definitively treated, has been disease-free for <= years and in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK Medical Monitor will not affect the evaluation of the effects of the study treatment on the currently targeted malignancy, may be included in this clinical trial; and curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer.
Any prior invasive malignancy within  years before randomization
No evidence of disease (in situ or invasive cancer that would normally be treated by resection) at trial entry as determined by the investigator; diagnosis of invasive cancer must be at least  years prior to initiation on trial
