Child Pugh B or C stage liver disease
Child Pugh B or C disease
Child-Pugh scores -
If patient has underlying cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh classification group A patients should be included in this study; clinical assessment of ascites and encephalopathy is required; Child-Pugh classification must be determined for all study participants at the time of eligibility analysis; as albumin and prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) are required for Child-Pugh classification; these labs should be drawn with other labs required for eligibility analysis
Patients with Child Pugh B or C liver failure will be excluded
Child-Pugh A or B
Must have Child-Pugh A or B liver disease
Child-Pugh C liver function
Patients with Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B (if due to low albumin but not elevated international normalized ratio [INR] or bilirubin) cirrhosis are allowed; Child-Pugh Turcot (CPT) Classification System score will be based upon INR, total bilirubin and serum albumin, as well as the presence/absence of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy
Child-Pugh B (except Child-Pugh B due to low albumin) or Child-Pugh C cirrhosis
Child-Pugh status C
Child-Turcotte-Pugh Classification A or B
Must have Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) A or B
Patients with Child-Pugh A-C liver disease
Patients with liver disease Child Pugh classification B and C.
Child Pugh B and C
Cirrhosis grade of Child-Pugh class A; Child-Pugh status should be calculated based on clinical findings and laboratory results during the screening period
Child-Pugh Stage: A or B for Parts A & B, A for Part C, and D
Child Pugh A
If patient has underlying cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh classification Group A patients may be included in the resectable cohort of this study; for patients with unresectable disease, Child-Pugh classification Groups A and B are allowed; clinical assessment of ascites and encephalopathy is required; Child-Pugh classification must be determined for all study participants at the time of eligibility analysis; note albumin and prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) are required for Child-Pugh classification; these laboratories (labs) should be drawn with the other labs required for eligibility analysis
Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh grade A. Child-Pugh status should be determined based on clinical findings and laboratory data during the screening period (Appendix B). Subjects on anti-coagulants are to receive  point for their INR status, as they are presumed to have a <. baseline PT/INR.
Child-Pugh Classification A (see Appendix D)
Child-Pugh B-C cirrhotic status based on clinical findings and laboratory results
Patients with Child Pugh liver function worse than B
Child-Pugh category A
Child Pugh A or B
Child-Pugh A/B
