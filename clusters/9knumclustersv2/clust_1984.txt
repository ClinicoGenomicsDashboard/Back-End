Received a current diagnosis of borderline epithelial ovarian tumor (formerly tumors of low malignant potential)
For endometrial carcinoma patients, a diagnosis of epithelial endometrial carcinoma is required. Stromal tumors and carcinosarcoma (mixed malignant Mullerian tumor) are excluded.
Patients with a current diagnosis of borderline epithelial ovarian tumor (formerly tumors of low malignant potential) or recurrent invasive epithelial ovarian cancer treated with surgery only (such as those with stage Ia or Ib low grade lesions) are not eligible; patients with a prior diagnosis of a borderline tumor that was surgically resected and who subsequently develop an unrelated, new invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal primary cancer are eligible, provided that they have not received prior chemotherapy for any ovarian tumor
Borderline or low-malignant potential histology
Histology showing mucinous or low-grade epithelial ovarian carcinoma
Tumors of low malignant potential (borderline carcinomas)
Patients with tumors of low malignant potential, except ovarian pseudomyxoma or with no peritoneal disease
Patients with pathology demonstrating mucinous, carcinosarcoma or low malignant potential tumor histology are excluded; in addition, non-ovarian malignancies, malignant germ cell or stromal tumors are also excluded
Patients with a prior histologic diagnosis of borderline, low malignant potential (grade ) epithelial carcinoma that was surgically resected and who subsequently developed an unrelated, new invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal primary cancer are eligible provided that they meet the criteria listed above
Borderline, low-malignant-potential epithelial carcinoma per histopathology is excluded.
Non epithelial tumors or ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (ie, borderline tumors) or mucinous tumors
Non epithelial tumor or ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (ie, borderline tumors).
Non-epithelial, including malignant mixed Mullerian tumors
Ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (i.e. borderline tumors)
Subjects with a current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential (borderline carcinomas) are not eligible
Epithelial ovarian cancer of low malignant potential (borderline tumor)
Borderline resectable- Tumors considered borderline resectable are defined as follows:

Borderline resectable- Tumors considered borderline resectable are defined as follows:
Non-epithelial ovarian carcinomas or ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (i.e., borderline tumors)
Non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma, including malignant mixed Mullerian tumors
Non epithelial tumor, including malignant mixed Mllerian tumors without high grade serous component, or ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (i.e., borderline tumors)
Non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma, including malignant mixed Mullerian tumors.

Borderline ovarian cancer without ascites
Patients with ovarian tumors of non-epithelial origin (eg, germ cell tumor) or any low grade tumors.
Histology showing mucinous or low grade epithelial ovarian carcinoma
Subjects with a current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential (borderline carcinomas) are not eligible
Borderline ovarian cancer with ascites is allowable
Borderline ovarian cancer without ascites
Non-epithelial ovarian cancers, including malignant mixed Mllerian tumors.
Ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (i.e. borderline tumors).
