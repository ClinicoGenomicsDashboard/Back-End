Pre-existing bilateral sensorineural hearing loss at >dB at any frequency from -Hz as assessed by a comprehensive audiometric evaluation for patients receiving cisplatin. This criteria will not apply to patients receiving carboplatin.
Severe major organ toxicity; specifically, renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal system toxicity should all be less than grade ; patients with stable neurological deficits (because of their brain tumor) are not excluded; patients with =<  hearing loss are not excluded
Normal auditory acuity: defined as a normal age-related audiogram without significant hearing loss.
Symptomatic altered hearing > grade  by NCI-CTCv criteria
Peripheral neuropathy >= grade  or clinically significant sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus
BLADDER: Subjects must be considered cisplatin ineligible as per treating physician due to renal dysfunction, hearing impairment, or co-morbidities
Grade >=  sensorineural hearing loss
Hearing loss >= grade 
Significant hearing loss that would prevent cisplatin administration
Patients who are ineligible to receive cisplatin:\r\n* Creatinine clearance of less than  mL/minute, hearing loss of  decibels (dB) at two contiguous frequencies, grade  or higher peripheral neuropathy, or New York Heart Association class III or higher heart failure\r\n* Hearing test will not be routinely done, it will only be done if patients report hearing loss at baseline or during treatment
Clinically significant sensorineural hearing impairment which may be worsened via cisplatin exposure (audiometric abnormalities without corresponding clinical deafness are not grounds for exclusion)
Patients should have an audiogram at baseline, and patients with pre-existing hearing loss or hearing loss during treatment should be assessed frequently during cisplatin therapy
Patients must not have a clinically relevant hearing impairment > grade 
Pre-existing hearing impairment
Existing severe major organ dysfunction i.e., renal, cardiac, hepatic, neurologic, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal toxicity >= grade  except for hearing loss, alopecia, anorexia, nausea, hyperbilirubinemia and hypomagnesemia from total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which may be grade 
Preexisting grade >=  hearing loss
> grade  hearing loss or tinnitus
COHORT II: Patients must not have >= grade  hearing deficits
Symptomatic altered hearing > grade  by NCI-CTCv criteria
Existing major organ dysfunction > grade , with the exception of hearing loss and hematologic toxicity (defined as suppression of all subtypes of white blood cells [WBCs], red blood cells [RBCs], and platelets)
Preexisting grade >=  hearing loss
Hearing: a) No clinically significant hearing loss, defined in Section ., number .
Patients with significant hearing loss are not eligible for study participation defined as hearing loss that affects everyday life and/or for which a hearing aid is required.
Serum creatinine > . or upper limit or normal (ULN), CCL <  cc/min, peripheral neuropathy > grade  and/or frequency hearing loss that interferes with activities of daily living are contraindications to cisplatin but not to carboplatin
Clinically significant hearing loss or ringing in the ears
Severe major organ toxicity; specifically, renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal system toxicity should all be less than or equal to grade ; patients with stable neurological deficits (because of their brain tumor) are not excluded; patients with =<  hearing loss are not excluded
Severe sensorineural hearing loss greater or equal to grade 
Hearing loss that would preclude participating in telephone sessions (determined by brief hearing assessment administered by research staff at each National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program [NCORP] component); individuals who can compensate for hearing loss through the use of a hearing device or telecommunication device for the deaf (TDD) phone, and through the use of such devices are able to communicate with the study therapist by telephone, will be included; if the therapist cannot communicate with the participant by telephone, the participant will be excluded
Neither has a significant hearing impairment precluding intervention session participation
Hearing loss that would preclude participating in interventions; adequate hearing to participate will be determined via: () response of no to the question [Do you have a hearing problem now?]; participants with hearing aids will be allowed to enroll as long as their hearing is adequate to hear the sounds on the study devices; if necessary, potential study participants will receive a brief test trial with the RESPeRATE device; if they indicate inability to hear the guiding tones, they will not be enrolled in the study
Visual or hearing impairment that would prevent ability to engage in the telephone session or study materials
Caregiver is deaf or has significant hearing impairment and thus cannot use the telephone
Adequate vision and hearing for valid completion of study measures
No significant hearing impairment that would prevent participation in sessions
Patients with communication barriers (e.g., hard of hearing)
Hearing level threshold =<  dB at all frequencies in both ears to be evaluable for evaluation of pantoprazole's effect on cisplatin ototoxicity; patients with hearing loss can be enrolled but will not be evaluable for ototoxicity objective
No hearing impairment
Vision and hearing (eyeglasses and/or hearing aid permissible) sufficient for valid test administration and cooperation with examinations
Hearing levels that interfere with following test instruction
Are deaf or hearing-disabled.
No hearing impairment in patient or partner
Participant has a sensory impairment (vision, hearing) that prohibits completion of neurocognitive examination
Uncorrected hearing impairments
Severe hearing impairment that limits the ability to use audio-based guided imagery modules
Prior history of hearing impairment
Previous or existing pathology of the inner ear with or without hearing loss (i.e. sudden sensorineural hearing loss, Menieres disease, autoimmune inner ear disease)
Having impairing hearing or speech
Communication barriers (e.g. hard of hearing)
Hearing loss greater than grade 
Subject has normal baseline auditory function, defined as ?  dB from  to  Hz, in both ears and does not have a history of sensorineural hearing loss.
Patents must have no contraindication to cisplatin chemotherapy including no clinically significant hearing loss unless willing to accept the potential of further loss of hearing, no symptomatic peripheral neuropathy
