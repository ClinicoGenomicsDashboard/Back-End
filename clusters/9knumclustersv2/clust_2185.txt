INCLUSION CRITERIA (SUBJECTS STRATIFIED INTO THE THORAX HIGH VOLUME TREATMENT SITE)
EXCLUSION CRITERIA (SUBJECTS STRATIFIED INTO THE THORAX HIGH VOLUME TREATMENT SITE)
Prior radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast or thorax
ELIGIBILITY FOR TREATMENT ON ARM : Ninety days must have passed since the last doses of radiation or chemoradiation treatment involving lung tissue or thorax prior to T cell infusion (to avoid confounding pneumonitis)
