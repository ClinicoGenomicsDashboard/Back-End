With otolaryngeal cancer receiving surgery with general anesthesia\r\n* Please note we are purposefully including patients with higher predisposition to delirium as we are investigating potential preventive strategies for this diagnosis of multiple etiologies; patients at higher risk of delirium (e.g., advanced age, chronic hypertension) will be included in our study; additionally, other common risk factors that exist in this patient population (e.g., alcohol or nicotine use) are thought to contribute to delirium postoperatively
