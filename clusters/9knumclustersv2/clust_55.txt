Subject must have measurable disease and must be a candidate for intralesional therapy with at least one injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion (?  mm in longest diameter) or with multiple injectable lesions that in aggregate have a longest diameter of ?  mm.
Subjects must be candidate for intralesional injection into cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal tumors with or without image ultrasound guidance defined as one or more of the following at least  injectable lesion >=  mm in longest diameter, multiple injectable lesions that in aggregate have a longest diameter of >=  mm
Primary tumor diameter ? mm
Patients with histologically documented metastatic melanoma with at least  cutaneous lesions measuring over  mm diameter; at least two lesions must be at least  mm in diameter to serve as the injected disease; at least one other lesion measuring at least  mm in diameter may serve as the non-injected lesion that will be measurable disease; patients will have stage IIIB or IIIC (in-transit lesions with or without nodal metastases) or stage IV MA disease with cutaneous or nodal lesions assessable for administration of LL; patients are only eligible if their melanoma deposits are not amenable to complete surgical excision; skin lesions that are  mm or greater are deemed measurable however lesions that are at least  mm in diameter will be preferentially utilized for LL injection
at least  injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion ?  mm in longest diameter
Measurable disease with greatest diameter ?  mm
Patients must have measurable CNS disease, either previously untreated (not counting systemic therapy), or progressed following previous radiation treatment; lesions that have progressed after prior radiosurgery should not be selected as measurable disease if they are suspected of being radionecrosis; the following measurement criteria are required (not counting tumor edema, as visualized by contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with slice thickness of . mm or smaller, unless prospective permission is obtained from the principal investigator [PI] allowing absence of contrast or thicker slices): \r\n* At least one CNS tumor measuring  mm or greater in longest diameter, OR  \r\n* At least one CNS tumor measuring - mm in longest diameter, plus one or two additional CNS tumors measuring  mm or greater in longest diameter, for which the sum of the longest diameters is equal to or greater than  mm; patient may have additional tumors as well
