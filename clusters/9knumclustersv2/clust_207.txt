The OctreoScan should be one that was performed while the patient was on a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR. If a patient has had an OctreoScan performed while Octreotide LAR treatment-nave, the patient must have a repeat OctreoScan performed after  months of Octreotide LAR treatments before entering the clinical study to prove that the index lesions or new lesions still meet the criteria for inclusion. It is acceptable to have patients temporarily switched to Octreotide s.c. (up to six weeks) in order to obtain an OctreoScan, provided they return to the same fixed dose of Octreotide LAR prior to the scan.
