Current or history of interstitial pneumonitis,
Patients with active interstitial lung disease and non-infectious pneumonitis or a history of active interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or that may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity. Patients with lung cancer with a remote history of pneumonitis following chemo-radiation treatment that has resolved are allowed.\r\n* Note: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) whose disease is controlled (per investigator judgment) at trial entry are not excluded.
Subjects with active interstitial pneumonitis.
Patients with a known history of severe interstitial lung disease or severe pneumonitis or active pneumonitis/pneumonia or pulmonary pathology that is not well controlled in the opinion of the treating physician and/or principal investigator (PI).
History of pneumonitis or drug-related inflammatory lung disease
History or the presence of pulmonary interstitial disease, or drug-related pneumonitis
Patients with a known history of severe interstitial lung disease or severe pneumonitis or active pneumonitis/pneumonia or pulmonary pathology that is not well controlled in the opinion of the treating physician and/or principal investigator (PI)
Has interstitial lung disease or a history of pneumonitis that required oral or intravenous glucocorticoids to assist with management; lymphangitic spread of the NSCLC is not exclusionary
Patients with history of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis are not eligible\r\n* NOTE: history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted
Has known history of/active pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or history of/active interstitial lung disease
CERITINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Known history of extensive disseminated bilateral interstitial fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, including a history of pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, obliterative bronchiolitis, and clinically significant radiation pneumonitis
REGORAFENIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Known history of extensive disseminated bilateral interstitial fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, including a history of pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, obliterative bronchiolitis, and clinically significant radiation pneumonitis
ENTRECTINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Known history of extensive disseminated bilateral interstitial fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, including a history of pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, obliterative bronchiolitis, and clinically significant radiation pneumonitis
Patients with a known history of severe interstitial lung disease or severe pneumonitis or active pneumonitis that is uncontrolled in the opinion of the treating physician
Currently have or have a history of interstitial lung disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment.
Has a medical history of clinically significant lung diseases (eg, interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and severe radiation pneumonitis) or who are suspected to have these diseases by imaging at screening period
History of interstitial lung disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or organizing pneumonia), of active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immune-suppressive doses of glucocorticoids to assist with management, or of pneumonitis within the last  years
Has interstitial lung disease or a history of pneumonitis that required oral of IV glucocorticoids to assist with management.
Have a history or the presence at baseline of pulmonary interstitial disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis.
Interstitial lung disease (subjects with existing pneumonitis as a result of radiation are not excluded, however, subjects cannot be oxygen dependent).
Interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis requiring oral or IV glucocorticoids
Patients with a known history of severe interstitial lung disease or severe pneumonitis or active pneumonitis that is uncontrolled in the opinion of the treating physician
Interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis that has required oral or IV steroids
Patients with active interstitial pneumonitis
Has a history of interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, non-infections pneumonitis, radiation-induced or drug-induced pneumonitis
Participant has history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR a history of pneumonitis that has required oral or IV steroids. Participants whose pneumonitis was solely as a result of radiation therapy for their NSCLC would not be excluded from the study unless they received oral/IV steroids to manage the pneumonitis.
Have a history or the presence of pulmonary interstitial disease or drug-related pneumonitis.
History of interstitial pneumonitis
History of interstitial pneumonitis
Patients with interstitial pneumonitis
Has a history of, active pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or history of/active interstitial lung disease
Known interstitial lung disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis requiring steroid treatment
Interstitial lung disease (subjects with existing pneumonitis as a result of radiation are not excluded, however, subjects must not be oxygen dependent).
History of (current and past) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (for past pneumonitis exclusion only if steroids were required for treatment), interstitial lung disease, or organizing pneumonia. Note: post-radiation changes in the lung related to prior radiotherapy and/or asymptomatic radiation-induced pneumonitis not requiring treatment may be permitted if agreed by the investigator and Medical Monitor.
