Within  days after bone marrow biopsy confirmed remission after the patients recover from their last course of chemotherapy, the goal will be to consent the eligible patient prior to the remission confirmation bone marrow biopsy at the end of the planned chemotherapy); ideally, the research samples will be collected during the bone marrow biopsy, and the patient will be enrolled to the study within  weeks of the bone marrow biopsy; if there is delay to enroll the patient after the bone marrow biopsy and research sample collection, it is ok not to repeat bone marrow biopsy within  weeks, after the last bone marrow biopsy, if there is no sign of disease relapse; a repeat bone marrow biopsy should be done if the delay of enrollment is more than  weeks after the last bone marrow biopsy; patients with confirmed remission within  days after the last bone marrow biopsy, without research samples collection, should have a repeat bone marrow biopsy conducted within two weeks prior to enrolling on the study
Bone marrow involvement (> %)\r\n* Note: bone marrow aspiration/biopsy can be performed at the time of diagnosis and does not need to be repeated unless there is a change in peripheral blood counts or it was performed more than  days prior to study entry
Patients with bone marrow failure syndromes
One of the following Ph-like ALL genetic lesions must be present in the diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood sample:
STEP I: Patients must be diagnosed with symptomatic standard-risk multiple myeloma (SR-MM) as defined by all of the following (except gene expression profile [GEP] status if unknown):\r\n* No evidence of t(;) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing on bone marrow or not available\r\n* No evidence of t(:) by FISH testing on bone marrow or not available\r\n* No evidence of deletion p by FISH testing on bone marrow\r\n* FISH should be from within  days of registration\r\n** NOTE: If the FISH result states that no immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) abnormality is present, both t(;) and t(;) can be considered negative; in addition, if the patient has a t(;) or t(;) translocation present, they can be considered negative for t(;) and t(;); if testing for t(;) or t(;) could not be performed for lack of sufficient material or non-availability of the probe in the test panel, patients can be enrolled on the study\r\n* Standard Risk GEP signature within the past  days (only if GEP has been done and results are available)\r\n** NOTE: GEP testing is NOT a requirement for the study; if the test has been done, patients found to have a GEP status of high-risk will not be eligible\r\n* Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) =<  x upper limit of normal (ULN) within the past  days\r\n* No more than % circulating plasma cells on peripheral blood smear differential or , plasma cells/microliter on white blood cell (WBC) differential of peripheral blood within the past  days\r\n** NOTE: This is NOT the plasma cell % from the marrow aspirate
New diagnosis of B lineage ALL must be made upon bone marrow or peripheral blood immunophenotyping; cases with myeloid antigen expression, but unequivocal lymphoid immunophenotype, are eligible
Bone marrow aspirates must be submitted for centralized minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment performed by the ECOG-ACRIN Leukemia Translational Research Laboratory
Patients must have bone marrow biopsy performed within  days prior to registration
Patients with histologic diagnosis (by institutional pathologist) of newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) arising from bone or soft tissue and with metastatic disease involving lung, bone, bone marrow, or other metastatic site
For the purpose of this study metastatic disease is defined as one or more of the following:\r\n* Lesions which are discontinuous from the primary tumor, are not regional lymph nodes, and do not share a bone or body cavity with the primary tumor; skip lesions in the same bone as the primary tumor do not constitute metastatic disease; skip lesions in an adjacent bone are considered bone metastases; if there is any doubt whether lesions are metastatic, a biopsy of those lesions should be performed\r\n* Contralateral pleural effusion and/or contralateral pleural nodules\r\n* Distant lymph node involvement\r\n* Patients with pulmonary nodules are considered to have metastatic disease if the patient has:\r\n** Solitary nodule >= . cm or multiple nodules of >= . cm unless lesion is biopsied and negative for tumor\r\n** Patients with solitary nodule < . cm or multiple nodules < . cm are not considered to have lung metastasis unless biopsy documents tumor\r\n* Bone marrow metastatic disease is based on morphologic evidence of Ewing sarcoma based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains; in the absence of morphologic evidence of marrow involvement on H&E, patients with bone marrow involvement detected ONLY by flow cytometry, reverse-transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or immunohistochemistry will NOT be considered to have clinical bone marrow involvement for the purposes of this study\r\n** This study requires bilateral bone marrow biopsies at study entry; the suggested approach for patients with large pelvic tumors in which a posterior iliac crest bone marrow biopsy would track through the tumor is to instead undergo  marrow biopsies on the contralateral side (either  posterior biopsies or one posterior and one anterior biopsy)\r\n* Bone metastasis: This study utilizes whole body FDG-PET scans to screen patients for bone metastases; areas suspicious for bone metastasis based on FDG-PET scans require confirmatory anatomic imaging with either MRI or computed tomography (CT) (whole body FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/magnetic resonance [MR] scan acceptable); whole body technetium bone scans may be performed at the discretion of the investigator and are not required; for patients without other sites of metastatic disease whose sole metastatic site to qualify for study entry is a single area suspicious for bone metastasis identified by FDG-PET, confirmatory biopsy or anatomic imaging evidence of an associated soft tissue mass at that site is required for study entry
