Females who are not currently sexually active must agree and consent to use one of the above-mentioned methods should they become sexually active while participating in the Study.
Males and females of child bearing potential must use acceptable methods of birth control which include oral contraceptives, spermicide with either a condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, use of an intrauterine device (IUD) or abstinence
Patient is practicing an acceptable method of contraception (documented in chart); female patients (or female partners of male patients) must either be non-childbearing potential (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or post-menopausal >  year), or of childbearing potential and use  of the following highly effective methods of contraception (i.e., Pearl Index < .%) from  weeks prior to administration of study medication, throughout the study, and  days after completion or premature discontinuation from the study:\r\n* Complete abstinence from intercourse\r\n* Intrauterine device (IUD)\r\n* Two forms of barrier contraception (diaphragm plus spermicide, and for males condom plus spermicide)\r\n* Male partner is sterile prior to entry into the study and is the only partner of the female\r\n* Systemic contraceptives (combined or progesterone only)
Women of reproductive potential must agree to use two forms of acceptable contraception (including one acceptable barrier method with spermicide) during therapy and for  months after completing therapy; acceptable forms of primary contraception include the following: combination (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, medroxyprogesterone acetate depot), tubal sterilization, vasectomy and intrauterine device (IUD); acceptable forms of barrier contraception include the following: any male condom (with spermicide) or diaphragm (with spermicide)
Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity or to use  forms of effective methods of contraception from the time of informed consent until  days after treatment discontinuation; the two contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method
Women of childbearing potential must use an effective, non-hormonal form of contraception from Screening throughout the Treatment Phase and until  days after the last dose of Study treatment  Acceptable methods include: copper intrauterine device or double barrier methods, including male/female condoms with spermicide and use of contraceptive sponge, cervical cap, or diaphragm
Male patients must use an effective, non-hormonal form of contraception from Screening throughout the Treatment Phase and until  days after last dose of Study treatment  Acceptable methods include male/female condoms with spermicide, or vasectomy with medical confirmation of surgical success.
Heterosexual women and men must agree to use TWO effective forms of birth control for the duration of study participation and for  days following the last dose of study medication\r\n* Men must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for three months after receiving the last dose of study drug\r\n* The following persons are not considered to be able to father or bear children and therefore are eligible to participate without the use of concurrent birth control:\r\n** Female with bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy\r\n** Female with fallopian tubes cut, tied, or sealed\r\n** Female with sterilization implant (e.g. Adiana, Essure) placed >  months prior to randomization\r\n** Female post-menopausal (>  year since last menses)\r\n** Male with vasectomy >  months prior to randomization\r\n* One of the following methods of birth control must be used by women of childbearing potential:\r\n** Combined oral contraceptive pill in continuous use for >  days prior to study entry\r\n** Vaginal ring (e.g. NuvaRing) in continuous use for >  days prior to study entry\r\n** Skin patch (e.g. Ortho Evra) in continuous use for >  days prior to study entry\r\n** Injection (e.g. Depo-Provera, Noristerat) in continuous use for >  days prior to study entry\r\n** Copper intrauterine device (IUD) (e.g. ParaGard)\r\n* Note: The following hormonal methods are NOT acceptable:\r\n** Low dose progesterone only oral contraceptive pill (mini pills e.g. Micronor, Nor-Q.D., Ovrette)  \r\n** Norplant subdermal implant\r\n** Mirena Hormonal Implanted Uterine Device (IUD) \r\n* In addition to the above method of contraception, one of the following methods of contraception will ALSO be used for the duration of study participation and for  days following the last dose of study medication: \r\n** Diaphragm, cervical cap, or cervical shield with spermicide\r\n** Contraceptive sponge (e.g. Today Sponge)\r\n** Condom (male or female type) plus spermicide
Currently using two forms of effective birth control (one of which is a barrier method) for the duration of the study for both males and females of childbearing potential. Effective methods of birth control include hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, vaginal ring), intrauterine device, or barrier methods with spermicide (i.e., diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide), or
Women of childbearing potential (WoCBP) may be included only if acceptable contraception is in place for two weeks before study entry, for the duration of the study and for  days after the last dose of AZD; WoCBP are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as  months with no menses without an alternative medical cause); acceptable methods of contraception include true abstinence in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle choice of the patient, tubal ligation, vasectomized partner, barrier methods (eg, cap plus spermicide, sponge plus spermicide, diaphragm plus spermicide, or male condom plus a spermicide), intrauterine device methods (eg, Copper T or Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system), or hormonal methods (eg, any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an oestrogen and/or a progestational agent and that is administered via the oral, subcutaneous, transdermal, intrauterine, or intramuscular route as an implant, hormone shot or injection, combined pill, minipill or patch); all methods of contraception (with the exception of total abstinence) should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their male sexual partner for intercourse; periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control; all WoCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within  days prior to study the initiation of therapy; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately
