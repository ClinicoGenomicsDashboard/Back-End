Patients with peripheral lung lesions - cm in size identified on chest CT with the intention to undergo bronchoscopic evaluation and biopsy; the decision to pursue biopsy will be made by the treating physician and agreed upon by the patient
The patient is found to have unfavorable anatomy to indicate that stereotactic biopsy could not be safely performed.
HER immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) ordered on core biopsy, if biopsy indicates invasive cancer; Oncotype DX or other deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing performed on core biopsy or not requested
For patients undergoing optional tumor biopsy:\r\n* No history of bleeding diathesis\r\n* Patients on anti-coagulation they must be able to safely stop treatment for purposes of tumor biopsy
Patients with an extracoelomic solid tumor requiring SLN biopsy
Participants must be undergoing a surgical procedure with the intention of removing more tissue than what would be taken for a biopsy
Biopsy reviewed by a University of Miami pathologist
Requirement for medications, which interfere with platelet function, such as aspirin, which cannot be stopped within  week prior to the biopsy (applicable only to patients undergoing biopsy)
An interval of >  weeks between the biopsy and MRSI
Have received recommendation for and are scheduled for an ultrasound guided FNAB, ultrasound guided core biopsy, excisional biopsy, lobectomy or complete thyroidectomy of at least one thyroid nodule.
Participants who do not have residual calcifications present on mammogram following biopsy
No evidence on biopsy of extracapsular extension
PRE-ENROLLMENT BIOPSY PARAMETERS: minimum of  biopsy cores
FINAL ENROLLMENT BIOPSY PARAMETERS:  standard biopsy cores plus targeted regions based upon MRI
Participants must be women who have histological confirmation of metastatic invasive breast cancer that has metastasized outside the region of the primary tumor and axilla; biopsy must be obtained prior to initiation of chemotherapy; it should be performed within  days prior to enrollment (patients with a biopsy of recurrent disease that is HER-positive and have not received HER-directed therapy since the biopsy can exceed the -day window up to  months); patients must have metastatic disease in lung, liver, soft-tissue or bone to qualify for the study (more than one site is permissible)
Sufficient fresh or frozen tissue remaining from pre-treatment core biopsy/incisional biopsy or willing to undergo biopsy (at University of North Carolina [UNC] via LCCC) for research purposes only (approximately  mg or one core's worth of tissue needed)
Is willing to provide archival tumor tissue from a biopsy performed within  months of progression during treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or osimertinib OR has at least one lesion, not previously irradiated, amenable to core biopsy and is willing to undergo screening tumor biopsy
The first  patients with adenocarcinoma will be offered an optional tumor biopsy (typically EGD biopsy) at  weeks; starting with adenocarcinoma patient #, patients must have an accessible tumor and must agree to tumor biopsy at  weeks; this will continue to be mandatory until a total of  patients have undergone biopsy at  weeks
Patients with peripheral lung lesions - cm in size identified on chest CT with the intention to undergo bronchoscopic evaluation and biopsy; the decision to pursue biopsy will be made by the treating physician and agreed upon by the patient
Have had stereotactic or ultrasound-guided biopsy with marker placement
Have measurable disease that is amenable to a radiographic or ultrasound-guided biopsy or may be biopsied in the office without radiologic guidance.
Sufficient fresh or frozen tissue remaining from pre-treatment core biopsy/incisional biopsy or willing to undergo biopsy for research purposes only (approximately mg or one cores worth of tissue needed)
Recently diagnosed (i.e., within  days of enrollment) with clinically suspicious or biopsy-proven early stage (i.e., stage I-II) NSCLC; the inclusion criteria will be operationalized as follows:\r\n* Recently diagnosed (i.e., within  days of definitive tissue biopsy) biopsy-proven NSCLC\r\n* Recently diagnosed (i.e., within  days of clinical diagnosis) probable NSCLC where \probable NSCLC\ is defined as a suspicious lung nodule for which the patient was referred for\r\n** Invasive diagnostic procedure (i.e., bronchoscopy or image-guided biopsy), OR\r\n** Surgical or radiation oncology consultation and \date of clinical diagnosis\ is defined as (whichever comes first)\r\n** Date of referral for invasive diagnostic procedure (i.e., bronchoscopy or image-guided biopsy), OR\r\n** Date of referral for surgical or radiation oncology consultation\r\n* Study sites should enroll patients that meet either of the above inclusion criteria as early as possible during the diagnostic work-up (i.e., if the patient meets the criteria for recently diagnosed, clinically suspicious NSCLC, definitive tissue biopsy is not required for eligibility)
The patient must have one negative cystoscopy  months following most recent biopsy
Lack of archive tumor tissue from a biopsy or surgical resection of a metastatic lesion done within  months of study enrollment. Patients will be given an option to have a repeated biopsy of a metastatic lesion if they had a diagnostic tumor biopsy intended for use in the current study that was performed more than  months prior to analysis, or there is insufficient tissue from the initial biopsy to complete the analysis, as long as they have not started treatment with a CDK / inhibitor. Otherwise, the patient will be excluded from the study participation.
For Concomitant Treatment: Prior tumor resection or biopsy up to  weeks prior to first MRZ dose
Safely accessible tumor lesions (based on investigator's assessment) for serial pre treatment and post treatment biopsies are required for participants receiving TAK- monotherapy run-in treatment for  weeks followed by TAK- plus nivolumab combination treatment [ approximately / response-evaluable participants]; adequate, newly obtained, core or excisional biopsy of a metastatic tumor lesion not previously irradiated is required. Mandatory biopsies will be taken before TAK- monotherapy, after the  weeks of TAK- monotherapy, and after  weeks of TAK- plus nivolumab combination therapy. An optional biopsy may be taken at PD with additional consent from the participants.

Mandatory biopsies will be taken before TAK- monotherapy, after the  weeks of TAK- monotherapy, and after  weeks of TAK- plus nivolumab combination therapy. An optional biopsy may be taken at progression with additional consent from the participants.
