Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease, either biopsy proven or with unequivocal evidence of metastatic disease by physical examination or radiological study
Presence of metastatic disease (stage IV NSCLC) is not allowed; subjects must be evaluated with a CT or PET scan prior to registration for protocol therapy to exclude metastatic disease
SAFETY RUN-IN: Disease stage: unresectable metastatic disease
RANDOMIZED PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL: Disease stage IV, metastatic unresectable disease
Prior exposure to cetuximab in the metastatic (stage IV) setting
Stage IV disease (metastatic or surgically unresectable, cTb, N+, or M+ cancer)
Metastatic (stage IV) triple negative breast cancer that has progressed after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting; non-measurable disease (i.e. bone metastases) is permitted
Stage IV metastatic disease with intracranial disease visible with magnetic resonance image (MRI)
Patients with a history of stage IV or metastatic disease
Patient has stage N or M (metastatic) disease
Stage IV metastatic disease (only during the phase II)
Patients who have received previous treatment for metastatic or stage IV disease
Stage IV (metastatic) disease.
Stage IV (metastatic) disease
Patients with distant metastatic disease (stage IVC)
Previously untreated stage III/IV advanced or metastatic MEL (Part C only)
No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies are required in the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings that would suggest distant disease.
Presence of metastatic disease (stage IV NSCLC) is not allowed. Subjects must be evaluated with a PET scan within  days prior to registration for protocol therapy to exclude metastatic disease
Have metastatic disease (stage IV) confirmed surgically, by imaging or pathologically
Evidence of metastatic disease (stage M)
Patient presents with Stage  pulmonary metastatic disease with metastatic disease previously confirmed by prior biopsy; or Patient presents with Stage  pulmonary metastatic disease previously confirmed on imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or CT) with histology proven primary cancer.
No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies are required in the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings that would suggest distant disease.
Patients with metastatic disease involving viscera or bones are ineligible; patients with extensive nodal involvement alone classified as stage IV disease, are eligible
Metastatic (stage IV) disease (including involvement of the colon, adrenals, or kidney, or radiographic evidence of peritoneal seeding or pulmonary metastases)
Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded as this would qualify as stage IV/metastatic disease
Patients with histologically documented metastatic melanoma with:\r\n* (Metastatic disease cohort) measurable disease, stage IIIB, IIIC (in transit lesions with or without nodal metastases) that includes lesions accessible for biopsies or IV MB\r\n* (Adjuvant cohort) subjects who are no evidence of disease (NED) and stage III or IV; this includes patients with stage IV disease resected to NED; stage IIB or IIC patients will be enrolled after review and approval by the PI
Metastatic disease (Stage IV) OR
Newly diagnosed untreated stage IV and/or recurrent after adjuvant therapy with metastatic disease
Advanced (FIGO stage III or IV), recurrent or metastatic disease.
Initial presentation: stage IV or metastatic disease, enrolled prior to any cytoreductive therapy
Inoperable or metastatic extra cranial stage III or IV disease
Metastatic (stage IV) BCa
Confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or stage IV BC
Metastatic disease (Stage IV C)
Staging to rule out metastatic disease is recommended for subjects with clinical stage III disease
Has metastatic disease (M) Stage IV C
Metastatic disease (Stage IV C)
Stage IV or distant metastatic disease
Subject has metastatic disease (M) Stage IV-C.
Participants with known metastatic (stage IV) prostate cancer
Patients with in situ cancers (Stage ) and those with metastatic disease (Stage IV);
Stage IV cancer or evidence of metastatic disease at any time point
