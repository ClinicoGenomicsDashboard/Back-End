All subjects must be screened for hepatitis B and C infection; subjects must either have no history of hepatitis B or C, or must meet the following criteria in order to e eligible:\r\n* Hepatitis B: Subjects infected with hepatitis B must receive anti-hepatitis B therapy; per Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, subjects that show no immunity, defined by the lack of hepatitis B surface antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection (i.e. hepatitis B surface antigen positive [HBsAg+], hepatitis B core antibody positive [HB core AB +], hepatitis B surface antibody negative [HBsAB-]) must be on anti-hepatitis B therapy throughout the study in order to be eligible; the exact hepatitis B therapy is at the discretion of the infection disease specialist or investigator; all patients diagnosed with hepatitis B must also meet the liver function test criteria listed above and have no evidence of cirrhosis; however, all patients who present with acute hepatitis B, or who show normal transaminases but are HBsAg+ and immunoglobulin M positive (IgM+) for hepatitis B core antigen, are ineligible\r\n* Hepatitis C: Subjects, who are hepatitis C antibody positive, with or without a positive hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) level, must meet the liver function test criteria listed above and have no evidence of cirrhosis; patients diagnosed with hepatitis C less than  months before enrollment will be considered to have acute hepatitis C and will be ineligible unless the hepatitis C viral load is undetectable
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis C antibody positive with elevated liver transaminases; all patients with chronic active hepatitis (including those on antiviral therapy) are ineligible
Known hepatitis B surface antigen and/or positive hepatitis C antibody and presence of hepatitis C RNA.
A positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) results
Actively infected with or chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) as demonstrated by positive hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg). (Patients who are sero-positive only, i.e., surface antibody positive [HbsAb], are permitted).
Presence of positive test results for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody
Known hepatic cirrhosis, hepatitis B surface antigen-positive status, or suspected active hepatitis C infection. Note: Participants who have isolated positive hepatitis B core antibody (that is, in the setting of negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody) must have an undetectable hepatitis B viral load.
Hepatitis B or C seropositivity (except for hepatitis B with negative surface antigen and hepatitis B viral load)
Actively infected with or chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus as demonstrated by positive hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen. (Patients who are seropositive only, i.e. surface antibody positive [HbsAb], are permitted)
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active or carriers) are not eligible; this includes all patients with a positive hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis B core antibody; previously vaccinated patients with positive hepatitis B surface antibody are eligible
Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test result at screening or within  months prior to first dose of study treatment.
Positive blood screen for hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV-, - antibody
Positive hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C serology (HCV) tests; note: hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and antibody to Hepatitis B core (anti-HBc); hepatitis C antibody; all patients must be screened prior to registration; those patients who have evidence of chronic or acute infection with either hepatitis B or C may not be treated on this protocol
Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg)
Chronic active hepatitis B; patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive; for patients with concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patient will require a hepatology consultation; the risk/benefit profile of transplant and hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the principal investigator and protocol chairperson
DONOR: Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C antibody negative; donors with a history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection may be eligible; however, eligibility determination of such patients will require a hepatology consultation; the risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting hepatitis will be discussed with the patient and eligibility will then be determined by the principal investigator
Known positive HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody.
Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (hepatitis B surface antigen testing required)
History of infection with the hepatitis B and/or C viruses or positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody
Known hepatitis B (they test positive for the presence of at least one of the following three markers in blood (to be evaluated at screening): hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG), antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), or hepatitis B viral load (hepatitis B virus [HBV] deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]), or known active hepatitis C infection
Subject has a known history of a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV).
Current or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (as detected by positive testing for Hepatitis B surface Antigen [Hbs Ag] or antibody to Hepatitis C virus [anti HCV] respectively); patients must be tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV =<  days prior to registration
Active hepatitis B infection as demonstrated by test for hepatitis B surface antigen. Subjects who are hepatitis B surface antigen negative but are hepatitis B core antibody positive must have undetectable hepatitis B DNA and receive prophylaxis against viral reactivation.
Chronic hepatitis B or C infection (e.g. hepatitis B surface antigen [Ag] positive or detectable viral load for hepatitis B or C); patients with prior evidence of hepatitis B or C without active infection are eligible
Documented virology status of hepatitis, as confirmed by screening hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and/or anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV)
Has known seropositivity for HIV or hepatitis C antibody, or known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive (testing for these serologic markers is not required for enrollment in this protocol)
Known active hepatitis B or C; patients must have a negative test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis C antibody within  weeks prior to starting study drug
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] positive but hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] negative with undetectable viral load are eligible), or hepatitis C infection
Subjects with positive test for Hepatitis B surface (HBS-Ag) or Hepatitis B core (HBc)antigen
Active HIV, HBV, HCV or HTLV / infection (due to increased risk of complications during lymphodepleting regimen and confounding effects on the immune system). Active hepatitis B or C infection is defined by seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg) or hepatitis C antibody.
Active or chronic hepatitis B infection (defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test at screening); subject with past or resolved hepatitis B infection (defined as having a negative HBsAg test and positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen test) are eligible; hepatitis B viral DNA must be obtained in subjects with positive hepatitis B core antibody prior to first treatment start
Active hepatitis B (defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test at screening) or hepatitis C
Known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or known positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antigen, or hepatitis C polymerase chain reaction.
History of any chronic hepatitis including alcoholic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), drug related, autoimmune, chronic viral positive tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), or a positive hepatitis C (HCV) viral load; these patients are excluded
