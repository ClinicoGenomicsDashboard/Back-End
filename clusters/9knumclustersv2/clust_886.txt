Within  days prior to registration: Magnesium within institutions normal range
The following assessments are required within  days prior to registration: sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), glucose, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and albumin; note: patients with an initial magnesium < . mmol/L (. mg/dl) may receive corrective magnesium supplementation but should continue to receive either prophylactic weekly infusion of magnesium and/or oral magnesium supplementation (e.g., magnesium oxide) at the investigators discretion
The following assessments are required within  days prior to registration: sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), glucose, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and albumin; Note: patients with an initial magnesium < . mmol/L (. mg/dl) may receive corrective magnesium supplementation but should continue to receive either prophylactic weekly infusion of magnesium and/or oral magnesium supplementation (e.g., magnesium oxide) at the investigators discretion
Serum magnesium within normal limits
Serum magnesium within normal range (patients may receive magnesium supplementation to achieve normal levels)
Performed within  days of patient registration: Serum magnesium > . mg/dL(can be achieved with replacement)\r\n* NOTE: The package insert for the study drug, romidepsin, does not require subject blood levels of potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) to be at a certain level; therefore in this study, we will require K > . and Mg > . for eligibility, but for the rest of the treatment parameters during the course of the study we will require these electrolytes to be within normal range (WNL)
