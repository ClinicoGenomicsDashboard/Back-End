Patients with symptomatic brain or bone metastasis are NOT eligible for participation; prior radiation and/or steroid therapy for brain or bone metastasis (mets) must be completed >=  weeks prior to study enrollment
No symptomatic brain metastasis; (note: patients with treated brain metastasis must be off steroids or on tapering or stable doses of steroids and have completed radiation at least  days prior to registration for protocol therapy)
Patients with known symptomatic brain metastasis; subjects with controlled brain metastasis (no radiographic progression at least  weeks following radiation and/or surgical treatment and no neurological signs or symptoms) will be allowed
Symptomatic brain metastasis requiring corticosteroids
Patients with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis; however, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease has remained stable for  months without steroid therapy may be enrolled
Individuals with the presence of symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis requiring radiation, surgery, or ongoing use of corticosteroids; untreated or brain metastasis causing any symptoms; treated brain metastasis must be stable for  weeks prior to first dose of study drug and not requiring steroids for at least  days prior to study treatment
Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis; however, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for  week or on physiologic doses of steroids may be enrolled
Symptomatic brain metastasis
Patients with symptomatic brain involvement
Melanoma patients with large or symptomatic brain metastasis, and in whom neurosurgical removal is indicated will not be eligible for this trial
Symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis
Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis; however, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for at least  months may be enrolled
Symptomatic brain metastasis
The subject has untreated, symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis requiring current treatment including steroids and anti-convulsants; neurosurgical resection of brain metastasis or brain biopsy is permitted if completed at least  months before the first dose of study treatment
Extensive active brain disease including symptomatic brain metastases or the presence of leptomeningeal disease, and all patients with infratentorial tumors\r\n* Note: patients with brain metastasis after definitive therapy with surgery or stereotactic radiation and stable off steroids for >  weeks are eligible as are patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis as long as less than  cm and thus deemed as not requiring therapy by the primary physician and the lesions(s) are not infratentorial
Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastasis
Patients with any metastasis in the brain or meninx that is symptomatic or requires treatment
Patients with uncontrolled symptomatic brain metastases; a scan to confirm absence of brain metastasis is not required
Subject has a history of, or current symptomatic brain metastasis.
Symptomatic brain metastasis
Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis or epidural disease requiring current treatment including steroids and anti-convulsant
Patients with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis; however, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease has remained stable for  months without steroid therapy may be enrolled
Symptomatic brain metastasis
Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis requiring escalating doses of steroids
Palliative radiation for treatment of painful bone metastasis, control of hemoptysis or treatment of small asymptomatic brain metastasis that become symptomatic during on protocol treatment is allowed; protocol treatment will be delayed until recovery from radiation at the discretion of the treating physician
Active brain metastasis or treatment for brain metastasis within  month of scheduled dosing day . a. Dose of corticosteroid, if any, for brain metastasis must be tolerated in terms of glucose tolerance ? Grade  (symptomatic; dietary modification or oral agent indicated) and hyperglycemia ? Grade  (fasting glucose value > -  mg/dL [> .
Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis
Patients who are symptomatic from brain metastasis
Symptomatic brain metastasis. Patients previously treated or untreated for these conditions that are asymptomatic in the absence of corticosteroid and anti-epileptic therapy are allowed to enroll
Symptomatic brain metastasis. Participants with brain metastases:
Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis requiring escalating doses of steroids
Known active, or symptomatic, brain metastasis
Symptomatic primary tumors or metastasis of brain and/or central nervous system that are uncontrolled with antiepileptics and requiring high doses of steroids
Symptomatic brain metastasis; patients with treated brain metastasis must be completely weaned off of steroid therapy for at least  days prior to starting protocol therapy
No clinical neurologic signs or symptoms of brain metastasis (brain imaging only required for symptomatic individuals per  National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] Guidelines)
Symptomatic primary tumors or metastasis of brain and/or central nervous system, uncontrolled with antiepileptic and requiring high doses of steroids.
The participant has symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastasis.
The participant has symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastasis.
