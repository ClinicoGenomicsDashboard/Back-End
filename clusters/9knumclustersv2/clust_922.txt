There are no minimum hematological parameter requirements prior to the first two cycles, as patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are understood to have low ANC and platelet counts when the disease is active; however, patients with white blood cell (WBC) greater than , will receive hydroxyurea to reduce the WBC count to below , at which point they may begin treatment

(Hydroxyurea is allowed for up to  days after the start of AG- for the control of peripheral leukemic blasts in subjects with white blood cell [WBC] counts >,/?L as well as prior to enrollment).
Use of investigational agents/any anticancer therapy within  weeks before study entry with the exception of hydroxyurea (NOTE: for patients with hyperleukocytosis [white blood cell (WBC) > ,/uL], hydroxyurea [and leukapheresis, if clinically indicated] will be initiated and these patients will receive -azacytidine when the WBC count has decreased to =< ,/uL; hydroxyurea can be overlapped with -azacytidine in selected cases, after consultation with the study chair; hydroxyurea must be discontinued before the initiation of the HiDAC/mitoxantrone chemotherapy)
