Participants must have previously untreated HIV-classical HL (cHL), with the exception of up to  consecutive days of steroids, emergency radiation, or  prior cycle of cyclophosphamide to reduce tumor burden and improve hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of lymphoma related liver involvement
Participants must have a pathologic diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who are relapsed or refractory with one of the following: I. Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) ineligible patients ii. Patients after failure of ASCT
Histopathologically-confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma
Histologically confirmed classical HCL by the enrolling institution
Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or classical Hodgkin lymphoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, with hematopathology review at the participating institution\r\n* FL: grade , , A, or B are eligible\r\n* DBLCL: transformed indolent lymphomas (TIL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and aggressive B-cell lymphoma unclassified (BCL-U) are eligible\r\n* HL: all classical HL subtypes are eligible except for nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, which is excluded
Phase I portion of the study: Patients with histologically confirmed classical hairy cell leukemia (HCL)
Patients with histologically confirmed classical HL that is relapsed or refractory after at least one prior therapy are eligible\r\n* Patients with lymphocyte predominant Hodgkins are eligible
Histologically or cytologically confirmed T-cell NHL or classic HL (i.e., nodular sclerosis HL, mixed cellularity HL, lymphocyte rich classic HL, and lymphocyte depleted HL) that has relapsed from, or is refractory to, standard therapies (including autologous transplantation) known to provide clinical benefit, but have not been treated with bendamustine for their lymphoma; patients with limited exposure to bendamustine (less than  full cycles) may be included, based on principal investigator (PI) discretion; patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma must have failed brentuximab vedotin and a PD- inhibitor
Patients must have pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL); a biopsy at any relapse is acceptable; other histologies including lymphocyte predominant (LP) HL are not permitted
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must have pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL); a biopsy at any relapse is acceptable; other histologies including lymphocyte predominant (LP) HL are not permitted
Histologic diagnosis of classical CD positive Hodgkin lymphoma confirmed at enrolling institution
Inclusion Criteria:\n\n        Each participant must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the\n        study:\n\n          . Histologically confirmed CD+ classical HL.\n\n          . Advanced stage, newly diagnosed HL (Stage III and Stage IV disease).\n\n          . Treatment-naive HL.\n\n          . Have performance scores of greater than or equal to (>=)  for Lansky\n             Play-performance or Karnofsky Performance Status.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          . Nodular lymphocyte predominant HL.\n\n          . Known active cerebral/meningeal disease, including signs or symptoms of progressive\n             multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or any history of PML.\n\n          . Any sensory or motor peripheral neuropathy.\n\n          . Symptomatic neurologic disease compromising normal activities of daily living or\n             requiring medications.
Histological diagnosis of relapsed or refractory classical HL
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma determined by local hematopathology review
Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of B-NHL, T-NHL, or HL; only patients with classical HL must have documented histologic demonstration of CD+ cells adjacent to the Reed Sternberg cells; patients must have received at least one prior standard systemic therapy with documented recurrent or refractory disease; patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), T-NHL, or other high-risk malignancies may be enrolled/transplanted in complete remission (CR)/first partial remission (PR)
Diagnosis of CD+ classical Hodgkin lymphoma reconfirmed by histopathology. Note: where reconfirmation is not possible, patients will still be eligible where they have confirmation clearly documented in their medical records.
Subjects with classical carcinoid
Newly diagnosed and previously untreated classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cohort D)
Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of B-NHL, T-NHL, or HL; only patients with classical HL must have documented histologic demonstration of CD+ cells adjacent to the Reed Sternberg cells; patients must have received at least one prior standard systemic therapy with documented recurrent or refractory disease; patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), T-NHL, or other high-risk malignancies may be enrolled/transplanted in complete remission (CR)/first partial remission (PR)
Histologically confirmed classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)
Relapsed or refractory de novo classical Hodgkin lymphoma
Histopathological diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma
Patient must have histologically documented classical Hodgkin lymphoma that was recurrent or refractory to standard chemotherapy
Histologically confirmed diagnosis of classical HL
Histologically confirmed classical Hodgkin lymphoma (nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, or lymphocyte-rich classical HL)
Histologic confirmation of classical Hodgkin lymphoma after imaging documenting primary refractory or relapsed disease
COHORT B OVERVIEW: patients  or older with untreated classical Hodgkin lymphoma (regardless of stage) will be eligible for cohort B
Histologic diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma
Previously untreated stage IA, IB, IIA or IIB classical Hodgkin lymphoma
