Patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation
Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation Note: prophylactic anticoagulation (i.e. intraluminal heparin) for venous or arterial access devices is allowed
Patients must not be on any anticoagulation
Therapeutic anticoagulation is not contraindicated, but for those patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, alteration in coagulation parameters is expected following initiation of dasatinib; for patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, coagulation parameters should be assessed weekly for the first cycle following initiation of dasatinib, weekly for the first cycle following a dose reduction, and weekly for a minimum of two weeks after stopping dasatinib
