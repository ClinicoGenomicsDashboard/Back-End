COHORT B ONLY: Obtained =<  days prior to registration: N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) <  ng/dL
Cardiac stage  or  with N-terminal prohormone (NT-pro)-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >  ng/L
NT-ProBNP >  nanogram per liter (ng/L)
N-terminal pro b-type Natriuretic Peptide [(NT)-proBNP] > nanograms (ng)/ Liter (L)
Must meet criteria for  of the following AL Amyloidosis Risk Stages (as defined by N-terminal proBNP [NT-proBNP] cut-off of <  pg/mL and troponin T cut-off of . ng/mL as thresholds):
Stage : both NT-proBNP and troponin T under threshold
Stage : either NT-proBNP or troponin T (but not both) over threshold;
Stage : both NT-proBNP and troponin T over threshold (but NT-proBNP <  pg/mL)
NT-proBNP <  pg/mL
BNP or NT-proBNP within normal limits
NT-proBNP ?
NT-proBNP >
Amyloid cardiac biomarker stage I or II disease Staging defined by NT-proBNP and troponin T cut-offs of <  pg/mL and <. ng/mL, respectively, as thresholds: Stage I, both under threshold; and Stage II, either troponin or NT-proBNP (but not both) over threshold. If troponin T is not available at local institution, troponin I may be used, but threshold is <. ng/mL.
NT-ProBNP > , pg/mL
