Has mesothelioma (pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, tunica vaginalis) of any histology that is relapsed or refractory after treatment with at least one pemetrexed-containing regimen
No more than  prior lines of anti-cancer therapy, one of which must have included pemetrexed and a platinum.
Peritoneal mesothelioma basket \r\n* Refractory or intolerant to platinum and pemetrexed systemic therapy\r\n* Any number of prior therapies
Received at least one prior pemetrexed-based chemotherapy for unresectable disease, unless within  months of receiving platinum-pemetrexed therapy for neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment that has been unsuccessful
For Part A (abemaciclib + pemetrexed): Non-squamous subtypes only. The participant must have received at least one but no more than three prior therapies for advanced/metastatic NSCLC.
Disease progression on or after pemetrexed and cis- or carboplatin
No more than  prior lines of cytotoxic therapy, which should have included pemetrexed and a platinum
At least one prior line of systemic therapy including platinum and pemetrexed
Prior treatment with pemetrexed <  months prior to starting study drug
Subjects who received any prior treatment with docetaxel are excluded. Subjects who have received gemcitabine in first line therapy but do not have squamous cell carcinoma, will be eligible as they can receive pemetrexed for the salvage regimen.
CRIZOTINIB PLUS PEMETREXED ARM B, PAXOPANIB PLUS PEMETREXED ARM C, CRIZOTINIB PLUS PAZOPANIB PLUS PEMETREXED ARM D:
Prior therapy with pemetrexed

Therapy that does not include cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, and/or pemetrexed
. Received only one prior chemotherapy regimen consisting of ?  cycles of pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin; subjects must have documentation of an ongoing response (confirmed PR or SD) following completion of this regimen. Subjects changing from cisplatin to carboplatin or vice versa within the same course of treatment because of platinum toxicity will be considered to have had first-line chemotherapy.
