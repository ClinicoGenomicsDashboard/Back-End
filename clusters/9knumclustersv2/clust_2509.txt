Concomitant administration of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not permitted during the study; patients receiving PPI therapy before enrollment must stop using the PPI for  days before their first dose of study drugs
Current therapy with proton pump inhibitors
The intermittent use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), H-antagonists and antacids (including carafate) is only allowed within these guidelines:\r\n* PPI until day (D)- prior to the first dose of alisertib and prohibited for the duration of the study,\r\n* H antagonists until D- and after the dosing of alisertib is done,\r\n* Antacid formulations until  hours before dosing and after  hours following dosing
