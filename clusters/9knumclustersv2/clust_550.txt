Subjects on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis
Serum creatinine will not be used to exclude patients; patients on renal-replacement therapy (e.g., hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) will be eligible to participate
Subjects who require routine/intermittent hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis (due to inability to provide appropriate dosing schedule for oseltamivir) at Baseline. CRRT modalities are allowed.
