A separate Baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than  hours before the first dose of study drug.
Females must not be lactating or pregnant at screening or baseline (as documented by a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of  IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than  hours before the first dose of study drug.
Pregnant and/or lactating females are excluded; a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG]) is required during Screening, and a separate local assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than  hours before the first dose of Test Article
