A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis at least  weeks prior to study registration, have been off of corticosteroids for >=  weeks, and are asymptomatic
Known brain metastasis
History of uncontrolled brain metastasis unless:
Patients with known or suspected brain metastasis
Patient with brain metastasis must have had treatment of their brain metastasis completed at least  day prior to enrollment and be on stable dose of steroids or off steroids at the time of enrollment
Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active
Subjects with known or suspected brain metastasis, or brain as the only site of disease are excluded with the following exceptions
Active/untreated brain metastasis; whole brain radiation or gamma knife radiosurgery performed less than  weeks prior to first administration of study drug; previously treated brain metastasis allowed as long as not requiring steroids and stable on imaging at least  weeks after completing radiation therapy
Active/untreated brain metastasis: whole brain radiation or gamma knife radiosurgery performed less than  weeks prior to first administration of study drug; previously treated brain metastasis allowed as long as not requiring steroids and stable on imaging at least  weeks after completing radiation therapy
Patients with untreated brain metastasis are excluded; patients with a prior history of brain metastasis are eligible if they have received prior brain radiation, have improved or stable intracranial disease for at least  months after completion of last course of radiation, and are not taking corticosteroids for treatment of brain metastasis; patients with a prior history of brain metastases who meet other eligibility criteria
Known parenchymal brain metastasis
Known parenchymal brain metastasis
MRI scan consistent with brain metastasis as per radiology report
Untreated brain metastasis that may be considered active
Newly dignosed or active brain metastasis
Have extrahepatic metastasis.
Patients have known active brain metastasis
Patients with documented central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain metastasis) at the time of study entry; patients with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and are asymptomatic
Known brain metastasis
Known bone metastasis
Have a history of brain metastasis
Known untreated brain metastasis or brain metastasis treated within  months prior to enrollment in this trial
Patients with brain metastasis
A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis at least  weeks prior to study registration, have been off of corticosteroids for >=  weeks, and are asymptomatic.
One brain metastasis or brain metastasis resection cavity with maximal diameter >=  cm (or >=  cc) and =<  cm (or =<  cc)
Hepatic metastasis permissible; appropriate candidates with metastasis to liver may be considered for ablative hypofractionation using SBRT
Subjects with brain metastasis
Untreated brain metastasis
Patients with known brain metastasis
Patients with documented central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain metastasis) at the time of study entry; patients with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their treatment for brain metastasis and no longer require corticosteroids
No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis
Patients with brain metastasis have no signs of progressive disease  months after the completion of brain metastasis treatment (radiation therapy, surgery, etc.) do not require anticonvulsants or corticosteroids, and have been off such drugs for at least  days
Known brain metastasis
MRI detected active brain metastasis witch require other therapies such as surgery and/or radiation therapy. Patients already treated for their brain metastasis, surgery or radiation therapy, and have had stable disease for more than two month and NOT requiring steroids may however be included in this study.
Known active brain metastasis unless they have been treated and shown documented radiographic stability for  days
Known or suspected brain metastasis
Presence of central nervous system metastasis (including active brain metastasis); active brain metastasis would be defined as untreated brain metastases; if the brain metastases have received prior treatment (usually either with surgery or radiation), they are no longer active
Patients with brain metastasis
Patients have known active brain metastasis
Known osteoblastic bony metastasis.
Known brain metastasis
Documented extracranial metastasis
History of or known brain metastasis.
Known brain metastasis
The patient has a primary brain tumor(s) or brain metastasis (unless metastasis is treated and stable for >  days). In patients who are symptomatic, a brain scan is required to exclude metastasis.
Known brain metastasis

Known brain metastasis
Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis
Participants may have brain metastasis
Patients with measurable brain metastasis outside a -mm margin around either hippocampus
Known brain metastasis
Brain metastasis unless treated and neurologically stable
