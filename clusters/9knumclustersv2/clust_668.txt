For Parts B, C, D, E and F: Have measurable disease
Patients with lower M-protein values or non-secretory myeloma will be eligible if measurable disease can be established, such as serum FreeliteTM chain ratio >x ULN, measurable soft tissue plasmacytoma >cm by either physical exam and/or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CT-scan) and/or bone marrow involvement >%
Patients must have measurable radiographic disease; patients with previous complete resection are only eligible if there is measurable radiographic disease which is clearly felt to represent locally recurrent disease
Patient on the dose-escalation portion of the trial must have evaluable disease, defined as either measurable (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) or non-measurable disease (e.g. bone mets, pleural effusion or lymphangitic spread); measureable disease is required for patients in the expanded RPD cohort
Patients with (no measurable monoclonal protein, free light chains, and/or M-spike in blood or urine) unless measurable disease is available with imaging techniques such as MRI and PET scan.
Evidence of measurable disease either by RECIST . or elevation of serum tumor markers (AFP >  ng/mL or HCG > . mIU/ml)
All patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. In general, liver and lung lesions should be at least  cm, and patients with node-only disease should have lesions of >/= . cm in greatest dimension. Patients with disease confined to bone may be eligible of a measurable lytic defect is present or a serum marker is elevated (> x ULN). The Study Chairman is the final arbiter in questions related to measurability. Patients with a three-dimensional mass or pelvic sidewall fixation on bladder examination under anesthesia are considered to have measurable disease.

Patients with T-cell LL must have recurrent disease, documented by clinical or radiographic criteria, as well as histologic verification of the malignancy at original diagnosis. Patients with T-cell LL enrolled in the phase I dose-escalation study are not required to have measurable disease; however, patients enrolled in the phase II cohort expansion at the MTD must have measurable disease.

Radiologically measurable disease by immune-related Response Criteria (irRC).
Applicable disease criteria
Radiologically measurable disease
All patients must have no measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as lesions that can be measured by physical examination or by means of imaging techniques. Imaging must be done within  weeks of study entry.
Measurable disease will be required; biopsiable disease will be required
Presence of radiographically measurable lymphadenopathy or extranodal lymphoid malignancy
For expansion: documentation by established staging studies or clinical examination to have measurable metastatic disease per RECIST v. criteria
Patient must have measurable disease per RECIST . presented after tumour biopsy for the late disease progression
Patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease; patients with surgically resected metastatic disease at high risk of relapse are also eligible
Measurable tumor lesions according to RANO working Group Criteria. a. In the case that there is \non-measurable\ disease due to a radical surgical resection during screening, the subject still qualifies if Inclusion #(b) is met.
Patients must have measurable disease as defined by immune-related complete response (irRC) (Wolchok, ); all sites must be evaluated within  weeks prior to beginning therapy
Evaluable disease. In the absence of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly with defects or measurable extra-medullary disease is acceptable
May be treated with localized radiation as long as measurable or evaluable disease remains at untreated sites.
Measurable disease based on Cheson  criteria
At least one measurable lesion according to international workshop lymphoma response criteria; there must be measurable lymphadenopathy to follow with serial exam and/or imaging
Patients must have measurable disease as defined by revised RECIST criteria (version ., Appendix C) with one or more lesions that can be accurately measured in one or more dimensions within  weeks of entry. Areas of previous radiation may not serve as measurable disease.
Measurable Disease must be present either on physical examination or imaging studies; non-measurable disease alone is not acceptable; any tumor mass >  cm is acceptable; lesions that are considered non-measurable include the following:\r\n* Bone lesions\r\n* Leptomeningeal disease\r\n* Ascites\r\n* Pleural/pericardial effusion\r\n* Inflammatory breast disease\r\n* Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis\r\n* Bone marrow involvement (involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma should be noted)
Part A: Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the RECIST v. (Eisenhauer et al. ) or Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et al. ) or have measureable disease for multiple myeloma.
Radiologic eligibility (measurable disease) must be must be confirmed by the BICR prior to randomization.
Has measurable or nonmeasurable disease
Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease
Patients must have measurable disease; patients may or may not have cancer-related symptoms
Bidimensionally measurable disease (field not previously radiated)
Measurable evidence of active disease within  year before study enrollment
Symptomatic MM, based on IMWG guidelines. Patients must have measurable disease.
COHORT A SPECIFIC INCLUSION: Measurable disease on imaging ( cm) or measurable non-enhancing tumor
Measurable disease per IWG  criteria.
Patients with no active disease; (as defined as no detectable disease)
Measurable disease as defined by mINRC, RANO, RECIST v., or evaluable by nuclear medicine techniques, immunocytochemistry, tumor markers, or other reliable measures
Measurable disease on preoperative imaging
Patients who have measurable disease after diagnostic biopsy
Measurable disease as per IMWG response criteria
Disease may be measurable (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] . criteria) or non-measurable but must be present in at least one non-liver site, where presence is defined as . cm or greater and visualized on PET/CT with [F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG); patients with effusion only disease or disease only in the liver are not eligible for the study
Disease may be measurable (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] . criteria) or non-measurable but must be present in at least one non-liver site, . cm or greater and visualized on PET/CT with [F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Patients with effusion only disease or disease only in the liver are not eligible for the study.
Disease that is either:\r\n* Radiologically-measurable or evaluable as define by tumor response criteria from and MSKCC-Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved clinic research protocol\r\n* Detectable by biopsy (eg, bone marrow) and/or peripheral blood assays obtained within  weeks of study enrollment
Patient must have measurable residual disease, defined as tumor that is measurable in two perpendicular diameters on MRI; diffuse leptomeningeal disease is not considered measurable
Have measurable disease based on irRECIST
Measurable disease (assessed within  days prior to day )
For patients enrolling once escalation is complete, disease must be measurable per RECIST . criteria with last imaging performed within  days prior to first drug dose In addition to the criterion listed above, Patients in Phase a must have a histologically- or cytologically-confirmed, advanced or metastatic solid tumor, in  of the following categories: disease history specificied in one of the criteria listed below:
Radiographic evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease; lesions will be considered measurable or non-measurable as per definitions provided in RECIST version .
Part , Dose Escalation: Participants may have measurable or non measurable disease as defined by RECIST ./mRECIST (depending on tumor type).
Relapse/progression based solely on elevation of CA-, in absence of measurable disease, according to irRECIST criteria.
Recurrent or metastatic disease, documented by imaging (CT scan, MRI, X-ray) and/or physical examination. In phase II, measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] . is mandated. In phase Ib, patients with or without measurable disease are eligible.
