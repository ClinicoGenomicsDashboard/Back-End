Cervical cancer in situ
Potential patients with a history of another cancer other than basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical cancer in situ) may not be enrolled unless it is documented that their previous cancer was treated, they have been disease free for five or more years prior to starting this study and they are in their doctor's judgment at less than % risk of relapse of this previous malignancy.
Patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN/) confirmed by colposcopy and biopsy
Cervical cancer\r\n* Patients who are unable to undergo surgery and must have treatment for an inoperable primary cervical cancer\r\n* Patients with locally advanced cervical cancer in whom brachytherapy will be integrated as a boost to external beam radiation either a palliative or curative setting (definitive or postoperative setting)
Cervical carcinoma Stage B or less
For females, documentation that the participant is being followed with cervical cytology and/or HPV testing per current Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents and American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines; cervical cytology must be performed prior to randomization for women who are overdue for screening per the guidelines; women should also have confirmation of absence of cancer or suspected cancer upon visual examination of the vulva, vagina, and cervix within  months prior to randomization
Patients with another active cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN/cervical carcinoma in situ] or melanoma in situ); prior history of other cancer is allowed, as long as there is no active disease within the prior  years
cervical carcinoma in situ;
Endocervical curettage positive for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
Cervical carcinoma stage B or less
patients with high grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN/)
cervical carcinoma in situ
In situ cervical cancer
Known history of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least  years. Non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ or squamous intraepithelial lesions (e.g., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] or prostatic intraepithelial/intraductal neoplasia [PIN]) are allowed.
Atypical endometrial or glandular cells or evidence of invasive cervical carcinoma on cervical biopsy;
Pathologic findings consistent with\r\n* atypical endometrial cells or serious glandular-cell atypia (atypical glandular cells, favor neoplasia cytology diagnosis)\r\n* evidence of cervical carcinoma on Pap smear or biopsy\r\n* more than two cervical quadrants of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade  (CIN ) as visualized by colposcopy\r\n* nonvisual squamous columnar junction on colposcopy with no concurrent endocervical sampling performed
Cervical carcinoma of Stage B or less.
Another active cancer (excluding adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]/cervical carcinoma in situ or melanoma in situ). Prior history of other cancer is allowed as long as there is no active disease within the prior  years
Cervical carcinoma of Stage B or less.
Less than  mm of cervical stromal invasion
Another active cancer (excluding adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]/cervical carcinoma in situ or melanoma in situ). Prior history of other cancer is allowed as long as there is no active disease within the prior  years
Cervical intra epithelial neoplasia
Another known malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment (excluding adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia/cervical carcinoma in situ or melanoma in situ). Prior history of other cancer is allowed, as long as there is no active disease within the prior  years.
Advanced cervical or endometrial cancer, T/T lesions
Metastatic cervical or uterine cancer.
Cervical carcinoma of Stage B or less.
Concurrent, clinically significant, active malignancies (excluding basal cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] in situ or melanoma in situ) (Stage II portion only)
Participants with carcinoma of the cervical stump
Presence of previous or concomitant neoplasm with exclusion of in situ cervical cancer
History of cervical cancer
Underlying cervical segmentation or other cervical spinal anomaly that results in differential nerve root pressures
For females, documentation that the participant is being followed with cervical cytology and/or HPV testing per current Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents and American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines; cervical cytology must be performed prior to enrollment for women who are overdue for screening per the guidelines; women should also have confirmation of absence of cancer or suspected cancer upon visual examination of the vulva, vagina, and cervix within  months prior to enrollment
Women who are regularly screened for cervical cancer are not eligible
Women must have a cervix to receive cervical cancer screening
No history of invasive cervical cancer
Have a history of cervical cancer
For females, documentation that the participant is being followed with cervical cytology and/or HPV testing per current Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents and American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines; cervical cytology must be performed prior to enrollment for women who are overdue for screening per the guidelines; women should also have confirmation of absence of cancer or suspected cancer upon visual examination of the vulva, vagina, and cervix within  months prior to enrollment
Carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the cervix or history of cervical cancer
Prior history of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal cancer
Any previous surgical excision of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or hysterectomy
Women undergoing colposcopy for an abnormal Pap test, positive HPV test or history of cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] or adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS])
Undergoing colposcopy for the diagnosis of cervical cancer and LEEP or cervical biopsy for the treatment of premalignant cervical dysplasia
History of anal or cervical cancer
Any woman with a confirmed preoperative diagnosis of cervical AIS, including co-existing squamous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and/or microinvasive cancer
Cervical carcinoma in situ
