Patients are permitted to have been treated with previous systemic chemotherapy; a minimal time interval since last dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy must be equal to or greater than  days, and all acute toxicities should be resolved to less than grade , and hematologic counts should meet study criteria; with regards to toxicity, patients who have left sided chest wall recurrences should not have previously exceeded more than  mg/m^ doxorubicin due to expected cumulative cardiotoxicity; prior taxane therapy is allowed, however, there should be no reported anaphylactic reactions of grade  or higher
