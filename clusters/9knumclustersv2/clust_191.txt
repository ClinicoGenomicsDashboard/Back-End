Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must have a negative serum pregnancy test before initiation of study treatment and must also use highly effective methods of contraception while enrolled in the study. The use of highly effective contraception should continue for at least  days after the last dose of study treatment or until the last day of TFR/TFR-, or for the duration of a monthly cycle of oral contraception, whichever is longer. Acceptable forms of highly effective contraception methods include: a. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception and male/female sterilization defined as:
Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must be willing to use an acceptable method of birth control prior to study entry and for the duration of the study; acceptable methods of contraception include hormonal, barrier methods, intrauterine device, tubal ligation/vasectomy or abstinence
A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than % per year) when used consistently and correctly. Acceptable methods of contraception are described in Table ..-. Sustained abstinence is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception
Female subjects of child-bearing potential who are unwilling to use highly effective contraception (e.g., combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) or progestogen-only hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner, sexual abstinence or equivalent measures) for the duration of study treatment
Before enrollment, a woman must be one of the following:\r\n* Not of childbearing potential, defined as:\r\n** Postmenopausal (>  years of age with amenorrhea for at least  months or any age with amenorrhea for at least  months and a serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level >  IU/mL)\r\n** Permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) \r\n** Otherwise be incapable of pregnancy\r\n* Of childbearing potential and practicing a highly effective method of birth control (consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for subjects participating in clinical studies) during the study and for  months after receiving the last dose of study agent NOTE: Examples include established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); barrier methods: condom with spermicidals (including foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidals; male partner sterilization (the vasectomized partner should be the sole partner for that subject); true abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject); Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study (e.g., woman who is not heterosexually active becomes active) a woman must begin a highly effective method of birth control, as described above
At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of one method of highly effective contraception as listed below:\r\n* HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION\r\n** Male condoms with spermicide\r\n** Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena by WOCBP subject or male subjects WOCBP partner\r\n** Female partners of male subjects participating in the study may use hormone based contraceptives as one of the acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug\r\n** IUDs, such as ParaGard\r\n** Tubal ligation\r\n** Vasectomy\r\n** Complete abstinence\r\n*** Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs; female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests; acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence
Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to father a child must agree to use highly effective contraception while on study drug and for  days after the last dose of avelumab; WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within  days of initiation of dosing; highly effective contraceptive measures include: stable use of oral contraceptives such as combined estrogen and progestogen and progestogen only hormonal contraception or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives for  or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy and sexual abstinence\r\n* Contraception is not required for men with documented vasectomy\r\n* Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least  months in order not to be considered of childbearing potential\r\n* Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation
