Participants who have received prior treatment with a CDK/ inhibitor
Prior exposure to transcriptional kinase family CDK inhibitors, such as the CDK and CDK inhibitors alvocidib (Flavopiridol), dinaciclib, and seliciclib. Exception: previous exposure to cell cycle CDK inhibitors such as CDK and CDK (eg, palbociclib) is allowed

Prior therapy with any CDK inhibitor
Prior treatment on a CDK inhibitor
Patients who have previously received palbociclib or other CDK/ inhibitors are not eligible
Previous exposure to a CDK/ inhibitor (palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib)
have a diagnosis of metastatic ER+ breast cancer in patients who received and progressed on at least two lines of endocrine therapy, with one that included a CDK/CDK inhibitor (e.g., palbociclib or ribociclib);
Received a prior CDK/ inhibitor
No prior therapy with any CDK / inhibitors.
Prior use of CDK/ inhibitors
Scenario : the patient must have received an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen plus palbociclib as standard of care or received a CDK/ inhibitor (palbociclib or ribociclib or abemaciclib) as part of a clinical trial, and demonstrated evidence of disease progression; if the patient was enrolled in a randomized clinical trial involving ribociclib or abemaciclib or palbociclib (such as the MONALEESA or PALOMA series of trials), then it must be known after study discontinuation and unblinding that the patient received the investigational drug and not placebo; documentation of progression and duration of response on aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen plus CDK / inhibitor should be provided whenever possible; no prior fulvestrant allowed
Patient who received any CDK/ inhibitor
Patients who have received prior treatment with a selective CDK inhibitor
Previous CDK/ inhibitor
Patient has had prior toxicity from a CDK / inhibitor necessitating discontinuation of the drug; patient may have had prior treatment with a cdk / inhibitor in the adjuvant or metastatic setting
Received any previous treatment with alvocidib or any other CDK inhibitor
Documented evidence of tumor progression on or after CDK /  inhibitor combination treatment; CDK / inhibitor must be the last treatment regimen prior to study entry,
Participants who have received prior treatment with a CDK/ inhibitor
Patients who have been in the past enrolled on a study of a Cdk inhibitor
Prior treatment with CDK/ inhibitor
Prior treatment with any CDK/ inhibitor.
Group  - Patients must not have received prior treatment with any CDK/ inhibitors
Group  - Patients must have disease progression while on or within one month after CDK/ inhibitor based therapy
Group  - Patients must have disease progression while on or within one month after CDK/ inhibitor based therapy (except those patients who received prior LEE based therapy).
Prior treatment with any CDK / inhibitor

Prior treatment with any CDK / inhibitor.
Prior treatment with a CDK/ inhibitor and/or bazedoxifene
Patient who received any CDK/ inhibitor.
The participant has previously received treatment with any CDK and CDK inhibitor.
Participants must have radiological or objective evidence of progression on an endocrine and CDK / inhibitor regimen in the metastatic setting, and/or relapse/progression during or within  months of completion of an endocrine and CDK/ inhibitor regimen in the adjuvant setting\r\n* Participants must have previously been exposed to CDK/ inhibitor therapy in combination with endocrine therapy; exposure to any prior CDK/ inhibitor, (including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib) is allowed; patients may have a line of endocrine therapy after combination endocrine and CDK/ inhibitor exposure\r\n* Participants must have remained on prior endocrine and CDK/ therapy in the metastatic setting without progression for at least  months prior to study entry\r\n* It is not mandatory to have a CDK / inhibitor containing regimen as the most recent treatment
Previous treatment with palbociclib, abemaciclib, ribociclib or other investigational CDK/ inhibitors
Previously treated on any CDK / inhibitor.
Progressed on more than one CDK / inhibitor
Prior treatment with any CDK/ inhibitor therapy
Prior treatment with a MEK inhibitor or a CDK/ inhibitor.
