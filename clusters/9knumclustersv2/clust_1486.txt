No currently active other malignancies which require systemic treatment
Any other current or previous malignancy within  years except protocol allowed malignancies
Patients with previous malignancies that have been treated with systemic chemotherapy with alkylator or anthracycline therapy. The latter group of patients are excluded due to an expected increase in late effects (eg. late cardiac toxicity, secondary malignancies, sterility, etc.).

Patients who have had chemotherapy (for other malignancies) within  years prior to registration.
Patients with other active malignancies are ineligible for this study, other than localized malignancies
Other active malignancies.
Participant has a history of other malignancies within  years prior to study entry, with the exception of:
Malignancies other than TNBC within  years prior to randomisation)

Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation or hormonal therapy, with the exception of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin
Participant has a history of other malignancies prior to study entry, with the exception of:
Concurrent malignancy or malignancy within  years prior to starting study drug, except\r\n* Malignancies that have completed therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than % risk of relapse, or\r\n* Malignancies not requiring treatment (e.g., RAI stage  chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL])
Concurrent, clinically significant, active malignancies within  months of study enrollment
Any concurrent active malignancies, defined as malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation, since adverse events resulting from these malignancies or their treatment may confound our assessment of the safety of adoptive T cell therapy for ovarian cancer
Patients with a history of other malignancies, except:
Patients with multiple malignancies remain eligible
Patients with other active malignancies are ineligible for this study, other than localized malignancies
Concurrent malignancies
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation

History of other active malignancies.
EXCLUSION FOR COLLECTION OF T CELLS/PBMCS: Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation
EXCLUSION FOR TREATMENT: Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation
Any other current or previous malignancy within  years except protocol allowed malignancies
History of prior or concomitant malignancies within  years of study start
Other malignancy within  years except for noninvasive malignancies
Patients with other malignancies or brain metastasis are not eligible; however, given the frequent coexistence of MCC with other malignancies, the following exceptions are allowed:

Other active malignancies
Other malignancies requiring active therapy or known to be associated with altered immune response
Previous malignancies
Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies with less than  years disease-free interval at the time of enrollment
Patients with active (uncontrolled, metastatic) second malignancies are excluded.
Relapsed disease or development of other malignancies
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation, with the exception of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin

History of other malignancies, except:
History of other malignancies, except
Other active malignancies
Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within  years of enrollment, with the exception of in situ malignancies
Subjects may not have other active malignancies other than indolent malignancies not requiring active therapy which the investigator determines are unlikely to interfere with treatment and safety analysis
Other prior malignancies, except for cured or adequately treated malignancies for which there has been no evidence of activity for more than  years.
