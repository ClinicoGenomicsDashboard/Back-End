PHASE I (STRATUM ): Patients with progressive DIPG, as defined by progressive neurologic abnormalities or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression (e.g., anticonvulsant or corticosteroid toxicity wean, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, etc.), OR an increase in the bi-dimensional measurement, taking as a reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since last treatment, OR the appearance of a new tumor lesion since diagnosis \r\n* Please note:\r\n** Patients with a radiographically typical DIPG, defined as a tumor with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of more than / of the pons, are eligible without histologic confirmation\r\n** Patients with pontine lesions that do not meet these radiographic criteria will be eligible if there is histologic confirmation of malignant glioma WHO II-IV. These patients must have radiographic evidence of progression
Stratum A, currently closed to enrollment: Patients must have a recurrent, progressive or refractory DIPG following radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy\r\n* Histologic diagnosis is not required for patients with typical imaging findings of DIPG (defined as patients with a diffuse expansile mass centered in and involving at least / of the pons); patients with brainstem tumors who have undergone biopsy with a diagnosis of high-grade glioma or diffuse infiltrating glioma are also eligible
STRATUM A: Histological confirmation of a newly diagnosed high-grade glioma or DIPG
STRATUM B: Histological confirmation (at diagnosis or relapse) of a recurrent or progressive grade II-IV glioma (including DIPG)
Patients with newly diagnosed DIPG who have received vorinostat previously will not be eligible for stratum I; patients with progressive DIPG will be eligible if they have received either one of the two drugs vorinostat or temsirolimus but will not be eligible for stratum II if have received both the drugs before
