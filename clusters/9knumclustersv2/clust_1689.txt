Women who are pregnant (determined by high titer of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) or breast-feeding; (women with reproductive potential must practice adequate contraception)
Pregnant or nursing women; women of child-bearing age must be tested for urinary or plasma beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)

Pregnant or lactating women; a beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level will be obtained from women of childbearing potential; fertile men and women should use effective contraception
