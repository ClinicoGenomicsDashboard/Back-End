Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin
Concomitant use of these drugs at baseline and for the duration of digoxin administration (if randomized to receive it):\r\n* The calcium channel blockers diltiazem or verapamil\r\n* Cardiac arrhythmic agents (such as quinidine, amiodarone)\r\n* Other cytochrome P (P) inducer/inhibitors\r\n* NOTE: patients already receiving digoxin are also excluded; patients who take calcium carbonate antacids (e.g., Maalox, Tums, Rolaids) or antidiarrheal adsorbents (kaolin and pectin) should avoid taking these at the same time as the digoxin dose
Unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure or cardiac arrhythmia requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and digoxin are allowed)
Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin.
Patients with third degree or complete heart block are not eligible unless a pacemaker is in place; patients on medications, which alter cardiac conduction, such as digitalis, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers, or who have other conduction abnormalities or cardiac dysfunction could be entered at the discretion of the investigators

Any cardiac arrhythmia requiring an anti-arrhythmic medication (excluding stable doses of beta-blockers)
Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias and/or patients who require anti-arrhythmic therapy (excluding beta blockers or digoxin); patients with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded
On beta-blocker treatment; if discontinued, patients must have been off beta-blockers for at least  months
Normotensive individuals not already on beta blockers (may be on other anti hypertensives): SBP =< , DBP =< 
Any patients already on beta-blockers or contraindicated to receive beta-blockers
Hypersensitivity to propranolol, or beta-blockers
Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias and/or subjects who require anti-arrhythmic therapy (excluding beta blockers or digoxin). Subjects with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded
History of documented congestive heart failure (CHF), New York Heart Association class II/III/IV, with a history of dyspnea, orthopnea or edema that requires current treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-blockers or diuretics; NOTE: use of these medications for the treatment of hypertension is allowed
