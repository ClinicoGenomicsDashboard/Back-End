Liver function abnormality; patients who have liver function tests (LFTs) (including total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) >= twice the upper limit of normal should be evaluated by a gastrointestinal (GI) physician; unless there is a clear precipitating factor (such as an azole, methotrexate, Bactrim or another drug); if the GI physician considers that HCT on the high-intensity arms of protocol is contraindicated for that patient the patient may be considered for treatment on the lower intensity arm of the protocol or excluded from the protocol; patients with Gilberts syndrome and no other known liver function abnormality and patients with reversible drug-related transaminitis do not necessarily require GI consultation and may be included on the high-intensity arms of the protocol
