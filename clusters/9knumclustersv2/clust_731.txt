The participant has a primary brain tumor
HER-positive as assessed by local laboratory on primary or metastatic tumor
T stage , , ; surgery of the primary tumor is limited to incisional or excisional biopsies (i.e., tonsillectomy) even without macroscopic disease left; positive resection margins and/or gross residual disease at the primary site are allowed; evaluation of primary tumor extent may require the use of a flexible fibroscope if deemed clinically necessary by the treating physician
Diagnosis of primary brain tumor
For subjects receiving adjuvant therapy only, subjects must have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor with clean surgical margins, or subjects must have undergone resection of the primary tumor and be scheduled for further treatment of the primary tumor with curative intent. Definitive treatment must be planned to be completed within approximately  months of randomization
Radiation to primary tumor prior to enrollment in this study
The subject has a primary brain tumor
HER-positive primary or metastatic tumor as assessed by central laboratory
HER-positive tumor (primary tumor or metastatic lesion) as confirmed by central\n             laboratory HER testing (immunohistochemistry and/or in-situ hybridization)
Primary tumor and any positive node(s)measurable in  dimensions
Uncontrolled tumor in the brain
Unknown primary tumor.
The patient has a primary brain tumor. Patients may have brain metastases from another primary site.
Radiation to primary tumor prior to enrollment in this study
HER-positive tumor (primary tumor or metastasis)
HER-positive as assessed by local laboratory on primary or metastatic tumor
Uncontrolled tumor in the brain
Systemic disease burden with metastatic tumor to the brain
Extremity or central axis (including craniofacial) primary tumor; localized or metastatic
Diagnosis of a primary brain tumor treated with at least one of the following:\r\n* Neurosurgical resection of the brain tumor\r\n* Cranial irradiation\r\n* Any chemotherapy to treat the brain tumor

Patient is a candidate for cerebral tumor resection with lesion suspected to be or previously biopsy proven to be a primary brain tumor.
Two adult patient groups will be eligible for inclusion in this study: \r\n* Group A: Patients where there is compelling evidence, based on the MRI and/or CT imaging, that a high-grade primary brain tumor is present; pathologic confirmation will occur with biopsy or surgery; patients whose tumor is felt to be inoperable and a biopsy is performed but no surgery; patients with a newly diagnosed primary malignant brain tumor (World Health Organization [WHO] grade III or IV) who will be receiving chemoradiation and who either did not undergo surgical resection or underwent incomplete resection with residual tumor >= . cm in greatest diameter by contrast MRI postoperatively\r\n* Group B: Patients with pathologically proven malignant brain tumor (WHO grade III or IV glial-based tumors) who have undergone chemoradiation and have MRI-documented possible recurrence/progression versus treatment effect (pseudoprogression) within  months from the time of completion of chemoradiation
