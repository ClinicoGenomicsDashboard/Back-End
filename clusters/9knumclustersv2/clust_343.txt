Subjects should be willing to abstain from use of hormonal therapies (e.g. hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive pills, hormone-containing IUDs, and E-string) and chronic NSAID's for the duration of the study (chronic use of NSAID's is defined as a frequency > times/week for more than two weeks per year and includes low dose aspirin).
