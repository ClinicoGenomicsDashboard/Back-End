For Part II (Arm C): Patients can have either locally advanced or metastatic pancreas adenocarcinoma; up to two prior treatment regimens are permissible (excluding a prior PARP inhibitor) for either localized or metastatic pancreas adenocarcinoma; prior combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy is permissible provided the patient has measurable disease outside the radiation port; prior therapy must have been completed at least  weeks prior to starting study therapy
Histologically-proven invasive adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
Have a newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the head, neck and uncinate of the pancreas, and is a candidate for a pancreaticoduodenectomy; if the biopsy is not sufficient for diagnosis, the patient can be considered to meet eligibility if the study team agrees that clinically the patients tumor is suspected to be adenocarcinoma
Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (within the last  days)
Arm : histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is locally advanced or metastatic

Cohort  (MTD) only: metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease is allowed
COHORT II (MTD): metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and tumor amenable to biopsies; prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease is allowed
Have histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; patients with mixed histology will be excluded
PHASE II: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease
Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas prior to registration
Subject has a definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Subjects with islet cell neoplasms are excluded.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are not eligible.
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas,
Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that has been documented to be resectable by standardized radiographic criteria by a pancreatic surgeon
Histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
Histological documentation of primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the pancreas; most cases will be adenocarcinoma; cases with undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma will also be eligible
Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is considered unresectable or borderline resectable based on institutional standardized criteria of unresectability or medical inoperability; patients with and without regional adenopathy are eligible
Have histologically- or cytologically-proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; patients with mixed histology will be excluded
Previously untreated, apparently resectable, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas at registration
A histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas confirmed by pathology.
Resectable primary tumor of the head, body or tail of the pancreas defined as a visible mass in the pancreas and:
Lipase < . x the upper limit of normal (except for participants with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas)
Prior systemic therapy for pancreas cancer
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; patients who have not undergone biopsy but have highly suspected adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with borderline resectable features on imaging study may also be eligible for study and undergo the pretreatment biopsy as per protocol; the biopsy must confirm adenocarcinoma of the pancreas to continue on study; biopsy is required within  days of starting therapy
Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is inoperable or metastatic.
Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
A histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas confirmed by pathology.
Histologically confirmed metastatic or advanced inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with immunohistochemistry (IHC) evidence of guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) expression indicated by an H-score of  or greater.
Treatment with  or more prior chemotherapies for advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is inoperable or metastatic.
Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas including tumors in the pancreatic head, uncinate process, neck, body and tail that are potentially resectable by pancreatico-duodenectomy (Kausch-Whipple procedure); patients with islet cell or other neuroendocrine neoplasms are excluded
