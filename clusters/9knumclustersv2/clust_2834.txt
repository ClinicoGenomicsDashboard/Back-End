Liver transplant
Residual disease at the time of transplant (bulky or minimal) or post transplant relapse as evidenced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity, specific cytogenetic abnormalities, an abnormal population on flow cytometry or increased blasts on bone marrow biopsy or in the peripheral blood; minimal residual disease (MRD) will be defined as detection in blood or marrow of any of the following:\r\n* Any leukemia specific marker (such as t(:) or t(:)) documented in the patients leukemia cells pre transplant on a post transplant evaluation\r\n* An immune globulin rearrangement known to be a disease marker for this patient post transplant\r\n* A leukemia specific phenotype post transplant at a level of ? .%\r\n* Mixed donor chimerism (any level)
the subject has recovered from transplant-associated toxicities prior to the first dose of GSK, and For subjects with a prior history of allogeneic transplant,
Prior liver transplant
The patient must be approved for transplant by the treating transplant physician. This includes completion of their pre-transplant workup, as directed by standard Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) standard operating procedures (SOPs) (DHMC SOP  Pre-transplant Evaluation of Allogeneic Recipient).
Measurable  disease of multiple myeloma at the time specified by one of the following:\r\n* If no relapse prior to transplant, values obtained at the time of diagnosis\r\n* If disease relapse prior to transplant and the patient did not have treatment for the relapsed disease prior to transplant, the values obtained at the time of relapse immediately prior to the transplant. \r\n* If disease relapse prior to transplant and the patient did have treatment for the relapsed disease prior to transplant, the values obtained prior to this therapy, ie, the time of relapse
History of renal or liver transplant
Patients who are transplanted at non-US transplant centers

Patient must not be a candidate for liver transplant.
Any prior or planned organ transplant (e.g. liver transplant)
Patients must be at least  days post-transplant
Both transplant and non-transplant candidates are eligible
The patient must be approved for transplant by the treating transplant physician. This includes completion of their pre-transplant workup, as directed by standard Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) standard of procedure (SOP)s (DHMC SOP  Pre-transplant Evaluation of allogeneic recipient)
Considered transplant-eligible, as determined by the opinion of the investigator at the participating institution; the participating institution does not need to be a transplant center but patients can be referred to a transplant center if needed
Liver transplant.
Prior transplant within  days
Additional Eligibility Prior to Transplant Two:
Transplant able to occur between day + and day + from transplant one
Relapsed or progressive malignancy after transplant, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease or any secondary malignancy diagnosed after HCT
Must be transplant ineligible as determined by their physician, or if transplant eligible, not expect to undergo transplant for at least  months after study enrollment.  Stem cell harvest and mobilization regimen is acceptable if clinically indicated, but must first be confirmed by the Takeda Medical Monitor.
received the transplant <  months prior to study Day 
Prior liver transplant
Transplant <  months prior to study enrollment
Subjects with multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkins disease (HD) and non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) who are considered eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBSC transplant by the transplant team at Kansas University Cancer Center (KUCC); subjects should be enrolled within  days of transplant
Relapse must have occurred >=  days after transplant
Living donor liver transplant (LDLT)
Prior liver transplant
Have had a liver transplant.
Subject is likely to be considered for allogeneic transplant in the opinion of the transplant physician (based on age of patient, health, cytogenetics, and/or molecular characteristics)
High-risk AML for which transplant is recommend based on cytogenetic, molecular and morphologic features; patients must meet institutional standards for disease control prior to transplant
Subject has had a liver transplant
Patients may have had autologous transplant; they must be at least  days post transplant, and have had recovery of their counts with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >  and platelets greater than  K at some point post-transplant, and be without active cytomegalovirus (CMV) or fungal disease
Subjects may be enrolled who relapse after autologous stem cell transplant if they are at least  months after transplant, and after allogeneic transplant if they are at least  months post transplant.
Plans to undergo a stem cell transplant prior to progression of disease on this study (these participants should not be enrolled to reduce disease burden prior to transplant)
Patients who have had a prior transplant
Started screening no earlier than  days after transplant, completed screening within  days, and randomized no later than  days after transplant.
The patient must be approved for transplant by the treating Transplant physician; this includes completion of their pre-transplant workup, as directed by standard DHMC SOPs
Participants must not have had a prior transplant
Prior AP, BC or allo-transplant
Transplant <  days prior to study enrollment
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT
If patients are found to not be in remission at screening, then the patient may be returned to their primary hematologist/oncologist or may receive chemotherapy as per standard of care for the malignant disease; patients for whom this would be their first allogeneic transplant must be in remission (< % malignant blasts in marrow and peripheral blood and no evidence of extramedullary disease) for transplant; patients enrolled on this protocol for their second transplant do not need to have attained remission prior to transplant
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT:
History of liver transplant requiring increased immunosuppressive therapy. (Participants on maintenance immunosuppressive therapy after liver transplant are eligible for Part A & B)
PRIOR TO POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOTHERAPY: Resolution of all transplant related grade III-IV toxicity
Patient may be enrolled  to  days after transplant
Must be transplant-eligible per institution guidelines
Transplant within  weeks
Patients regardless of eligibility to liver transplant, who have a comorbid disease that might preclude completion of study follow-up.
Patients wanting to pursue transplant
Patients cannot be on a transplant list
Transplant was more than (>)  days prior to study enrollment

History of liver transplant
Had a prior liver transplant or is planned to undergo liver transplant during the study period;
Four months post liver transplant
Transplant ineligibility
History of liver transplant
Patients who have undergone any prior transplant
Has undergone a liver transplant, kidney transplant or nephrectomy.
