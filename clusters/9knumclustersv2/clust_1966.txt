Serum total cholesterol level =<  mg/dL
Patients must have a serum triglyceride level =<  mg/dL and serum cholesterol level =<  mg/dL; if an initial random draw (i.e. non-fasting) is out of range, it is acceptable to repeat this test as a fasting draw
Patients with uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol >  or triglycerides > ) are NOT eligible for participation
Serum triglyceride level =<  mg/dL and serum cholesterol =<  mg/dL; if these labs were drawn non-fasting and do not meet the eligibility criteria then it is suggested that they are repeated fasting, i.e. no food or drink other than water for  hours; the use of medication to achieve these parameters is not allowed
Total cholesterol <  mg/dL
Patients must have cholesterol level <  mg/dL and triglycerides <  mg/dL before starting therapy; in case one or both of these are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication and documentation of cholesterol <  mg/dL and triglycerides <  mg/dl before start of therapy
Fasting serum cholesterol =<  mg/dL
Serum cholesterol levels must be less than grade  (<  mg/dL), and serum triglyceride levels must be less than grade  (< . x ULN)
Fasting or non-fasting serum triglyceride level =<  mg/dL and serum cholesterol level =<  mg/dL
Cholesterol =<  mg/dL
Serum total cholesterol level =<  mg/dL within  days prior to enrollment
Serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels must be less than  mg/dl
Serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels must be < grade 
Fasting level of total cholesterol of no more than  mg/dL
Fasting cholesterol =<  mg/dL; ONLY APPLICABLE for patients with NF mutation (GSK)
Baseline cholesterol must be <  mg/dL and triglycerides <  mg/dL (with or without the use of antihyperlipidemic medications)
Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol >  or triglycerides > )
Fasting serum cholesterol =<  mg/dL OR =< . mmol/L
SUB-PROTOCOL AIM A: Serum cholesterol =<  mg/dL
Fasting serum cholesterol less than or equal to  mg/dL
Have plasma total cholesterol <  mg/dL
Have plasma total cholesterol >  mg/dL
Serum cholesterol level =<  mg/dL (. mmol/L)
Subject has cholesterol panel and triglyceride done before first treatment
May be on cholesterol medications
Cholesterol >  mg/dl or triglycerides >  mg/dl despite treatment
Cholesterol =<  mg/dL
Fasting level of total cholesterol of no more than  mg/dL
Fasting serum cholesterol =<  mg/dL OR =< . mmol/L AND
Serum cholesterol >= Grade 
Serum fasting triglyceride level =<  mg/dL (=< . mmol/L) and serum cholesterol level =<  mg/dL (=< . mmol/L)
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol ? mg/dL (individuals with elevated LDL-cholesterol will be referred for clinical management of dyslipidemia)
Fasting cholesterol level <  mg/dl
Cholesterol =<  mg/dL (. mmol/L)
Total cholesterol =<  mg/dl
Have plasma total cholesterol <  mg/dL
Have plasma total cholesterol >  mg/dL or plasma triglycerides >  mg/dL
