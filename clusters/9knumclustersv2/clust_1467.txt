CTCL disease that is known to be refractory to systemic histone deacetylase inhibitors
Received immunomodulating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate within  weeks of screening
Patients may not have taken another histone deacetylase inhibitor (i.e. valproic acid, vorinostat) for at least  weeks prior to enrollment
Patients should not have taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, for at least  weeks prior to enrollment
Previous therapy with histone deacetylase inhibitor.
For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, prior exposure to vorinostat or other known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for cancer therapy; patients should not have taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor, for at least  weeks prior to study enrollment; note: this criterion does NOT apply to subjects treated on the Expansion Cohort (accruals post February , )
