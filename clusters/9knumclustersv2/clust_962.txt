Ejection fraction measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) >= %
Cardiac ejection fraction >= % (by either cardiac echocardiogram [echo] or multi gated acquisition [MUGA] scan); documentation of recent (=<  months from screening) outside reports is acceptable
Echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA): ejection fraction of >= % AND no finding of abnormal wall motion (i.e. report does not indicate that wall motion is abnormal or altered)
Adequate cardiac function (ejection fraction [EF] > %) based on multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or  dimensional-echocardiogram (D-Echo)
Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) >= % confirmed by echocardiogram (ECHO)/multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= %; -dimension (D) transthoracic echocardiogram (ECHO) is the preferred method of evaluation; multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) is acceptable if ECHO is not available
Cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction >= % by multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or fractional shortening >= % by echocardiogram (ECHO)or left ventricular ejection fraction >= % by ECHO
Poor cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction < % as determined by multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) or a shortening fraction below %
Patients must have a cardiac ejection fraction >= institutional lower limit of normal (ILLN) by multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or -dimensional (D) echocardiogram (ECHO) within  days prior to registration
Ejection fraction of >= % by either multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)
Subjects with major cardiac illness multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) < % ejection fraction (EF)
Ejection fraction of < % by either multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO)
For patients in stratum A, an echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) demonstrating ejection fraction (EF) > % is required within  days prior to study drug administration
Subjects must have a multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) and/or echocardiogram (ECHO) or cardiac magnetic resonance (MR); the required minimum standards include MUGA or ECHO or cardiac MR showing an ejection fraction (EF) of %; those with an EF -% must also have a cardiologist consult and assist with management
Echocardiogram (Echo) or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) with ejection fraction > %
Ejection fraction on echocardiogram (Echo) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) > %
An echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) demonstrating ejection fraction (EF) > %
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= % by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA)\r\n* Same method as used at baseline must be use throughout the study, ECHO is the preferred method
Left ventricular ejection fraction >= % by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA)
Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) >= %
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= % within  days prior to registration, evaluated by -dimensional (D) transthoracic echocardiogram (ECHO) or, if ECHO is not available, by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan
Patients must have an echocardiogram or multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scan; if the ejection fraction is < %, the patient will not be eligible; if the ejection fraction is -%, patients must have an exercise echocardiogram or dobutamine-echocardiogram (echo) with a normal response to exercise
Left ventricular ejection fraction >= % by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA)
Left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) should be >= %
Adequate cardiac function with LVEF >=% as assessed by echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA.
Patients must have either echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) with ejection fraction >= % within  days prior to registration
Cardiac ejection fraction  % (by either cardiac echocardiogram [ECHO] or multi gated acquisition [MUGA] scan)
Left ventricular ejection fraction > % (multi gated acquisition scan [MUGA] or echocardiogram [echo]) within  days of enrollment
All patients must have an echo or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan showing ejection fraction (EF) > % and normal troponin and creatine kinase (CK) myoglobin binding (MB) (echo may be done at the time of stress test as a stress echo); within  months of starting treatment; however if the patient has received cardiotoxic chemotherapy such as Adriamycin, they must have had an echo or MUGA scan since completing this treatment
Left ventricular ejection fraction >= % by echocardiogram (ECHO)/multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA)
Ejection fraction < % on echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA
Left ventricular ejection fraction >= % by echocardiogram (ECHO) (preferred) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA)
