Participants are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen
Participants are allowed to have received, but are not required to have received, one\n             additional non-cytotoxic antitumor agent (eg, biologic or cytostatic) for the\n             management of ovarian cancer.
Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted agents, such as bevacizumab) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for management of primary or recurrent/persistent disease (either alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy); PARP inhibitors will NOT count as a prior regimen when given alone
Patients are allowed to have received up to three prior cytotoxic regimens for treatment of their epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; they must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease, possibly including intra-peritoneal therapy, consolidation, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) agents or extended therapy (maintenance/consolidation) administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment; patients are allowed to have received, but are not required to have received, one to two cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease; (for the purposes of this study poly adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase [PARP] inhibitors given for recurrent or progressive disease will be considered cytotoxic; PARP inhibitors given as maintenance therapy in continuation with management of primary disease will not be considered as a separate cytotoxic regimen); if two cytotoxic regimens had been received for management of recurrent or persistent disease, one of these regimens would have had to contain either a platinum or a taxane agent
Patients must have had one prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for management of recurrent, persistent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (e.g.; paclitaxel/cisplatin, paclitaxel/cisplatin/bevacizumab), at least one which must have contained bevacizumab\r\n* NOTE: Patients are allowed to receive - prior regimens for management of recurrent, persistent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix; patients who have received more than two prior systemic regimens for management of recurrent, persistent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix are NOT eligible\r\n* NOTE: Prior adjuvant therapy is NOT counted as a systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for management of recurrent, persistent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix; adjuvant therapy includes cisplatin given concurrent with primary radiation therapy (CCRT) and adjuvant chemotherapy given following the completion of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (e.g., paclitaxel and carboplatin for up to  cycles)
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, up to two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease, with no more than  prior non-platinum cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen\r\n* Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) therapy as part of their prior treatment; for the purposes of this study, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors will be considered cytotoxic\; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, PARP inhibitors for management of primary or recurrent/persistent disease (either alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy); single agent hormonal therapies will not be counted as a line of treatment
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease, with no more than  non-platinum regimen; treatment with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent or persistent disease is NOT allowed
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted) therapy as part of their treatment for recurrent or persistent disease and/or as treatment for recurrent or persistent disease; if non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted) therapy is given alone (i.e., not in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy) it will NOT count as a prior regimen
one additional cytotoxic regimen and/or PARP inhibitor for management of recurrent or persistent disease.
biologic therapy (e.g., bevacizumab) as part of their primary treatment regimen or part of their treatment for management of recurrent or persistent disease.
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional prior treatment regimen (including a single chemotherapeutic, a combination of chemotherapeutics, or biologic drugs such as bevacizumab) for management of their recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary therapy and/or as part of their therapy for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease (e.g., bevacizumab)
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, three additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease; hormonal therapies will not count toward the prior regimen limit
Patients are allowed to receive, but not required to receive biologic (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their treatment regimen, e.g. bevacizumab
Patients are allowed to have previously received, but are not required to receive, one or two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or metastatic disease according to the following definition: cytotoxic regimens include any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in dose-limiting toxicity to the bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa
Patients must not have received any non-cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease, except hormonal based therapy is allowed; patients are allowed to have previously received, but are not required to have received non-cytotoxic therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen
Patients may have received, but are not required to have received, one or two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic therapy (such as bevacizumab) as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease
