Patients must not be candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant; NOTE: Subjects up to age  years who are considered fit for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, should be considered for enrollment on E, in order to avoid competing with that study; if a patient is considered unfit for intensive chemotherapy at the time of initial diagnosis, but subsequently achieves a complete remission (CR), then it will be left to the treating physicians discretion to consider hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)

Subjects must be deemed ineligible for both high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (based on age, performance status and/or comorbidities) while also having adequate organ function for CAR T cell treatment.
Prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant
The subject must be a recipient of hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant.
Hematopoietic cell transplant-co-morbidity Index greater than 
Has no other hematopoietic stem cell transplant of any type prior to the current planned autologous hematopoietic cell transplant
