Current evidence of any of the following:\r\n* Uncontrolled hypertension despite addition or adjustment of antihypertensive regimen\r\n* Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption\r\n* Active infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis) or other medical condition that would make prednisone/prednisolone (corticosteroid) use contraindicated

Pre-existing condition that warrants long-term corticosteroid use in excess of  mg prednisone/prednisolone daily.

Active infection or other medical condition that would make prednisone/prednisolone (corticosteroid) use contraindicated.
Any chronic medical condition requiring a higher dose of corticosteroid than  mg prednisone/ prednisolone once daily
Current evidence of any of the following:\r\n* Uncontrolled hypertension \r\n* Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption\r\n* Active infection (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis) or other medical condition that would make prednisone/prednisolone (corticosteroid) use contraindicated\r\n* Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study

Current evidence of any of the following:\r\n* Uncontrolled hypertension\r\n* Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption\r\n* Active infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis)\r\n* Any chronic medical condition requiring a dose of corticosteroid higher than  mg prednisone/prednisolone once daily\r\n* Any condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would preclude participation in this study\r\n* Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B or C)
