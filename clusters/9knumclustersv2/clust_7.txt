EXCEPTIONS:\r\n* Total bilirubin >=  mg/dL in patients with Gilbert's syndrome as defined by > % unconjugated\r\n* Total bilirubin >= . with direct fraction > . if patient is receiving a protease inhibitor at the time of initial evaluation\r\n* Hepatic dysfunction attributed to lymphoma, KSHV-MCD, or KICS
Total bilirubin =< . upper limit of normal unless the patient is receiving a protease inhibitor known to be associated with increased bilirubin (e.g. atazanavir), in which case total bilirubin =< . mg/dL with direct fraction =< .
Bilirubin =< . x upper limit of normal unless the patient is receiving protease inhibitor therapy (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, or atazanavir) known to be associated with increased bilirubin, in which case total bilirubin =< . mg/dL with direct fraction =< . mg/dL
Bilirubin < . mg/dl, or total bilirubin =< . mg/dl with direct fraction =< . mg/dl in patients for whom these abnormalities are felt to be due to protease inhibitor therapy
Total bilirubin < . mg/dl with direct fraction =< . mg/dl in patients for whom these abnormalities are felt to be due to protease inhibitor therapy
Pretreatment serum bilirubin =< . x ULN or total bilirubin < . mg/dl with direct fraction =< . mg/dl in patients for whom these abnormalities are felt to be due to protease inhibitor therapy
Bilirubin =< . X upper limit of normal (ULN) unless the patient is receiving protease inhibitor therapy (i.e. indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and atazanavir) known to be associated with increased bilirubin: in this case total bilirubin =< . mg/dl and the direct fraction is =< . mg/dl
