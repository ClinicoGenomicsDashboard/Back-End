Subjects who are unable to tolerate BRAF inhibitor and/or MEK inhibitor therapy due to grade >=  toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v].) from these agents, irrespective of antitumor response, are eligible on condition that: (a) toxicities persisted despite change from doublet to singlet therapy (i.e. from concurrent BRAF inhibition plus MEK inhibition to BRAF inhibition alone), (b) toxicities are attributed to a class effect, and therefore switch from one drug to another is expected to induce the same type of toxicity (e.g. ocular toxicities or cardiac dysfunction from MEK inhibitor), (c) drug-specific toxicities that do not resolve with switch from one BRAF inhibitor to another (i.e. dabrafenib to vemurafenib, or vice versa), will be eligible for enrollment in ; in other words, patients will be allowed to enroll into the NCI study despite lack of progression to MAPK inhibitor treatments, on condition that grade  or higher toxicities attributed to MAPK inhibitors resolve to grade , or less, at the time of study enrollment
Study participants with a history of prior treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors
