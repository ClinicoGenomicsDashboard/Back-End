Participants must be purified protein derivative (PPD) negative; alternatively, the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay can be used; an individual is considered positive for M. tuberculosis infection if the IFN-gamma response to tuberculosis (TB) antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control); the result must be obtained within  weeks prior to enrollment; PPD positive (or Quantiferon assay positive) participants are permitted if prophylaxis has been completed prior to enrollment
Patients much have a negative purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test and a negative Quantiferon assay or a tuberculosis (TB) T-spot test; indeterminate results, due to lack of response to the mitogen control reflecting their immunocompromised state, will be permitted
Subjects with a history of tuberculosis or a history of a chest X-ray suspicious for tuberculosis, unless confirmed to be purified protein derivative (PPD) negative or latent tuberculosis that has been previously treated.
History of tuberculosis or history of purified protein derivative (PPD) positivity
History of tuberculosis or history of purified protein derivative (PPD) positivity
All potential patients must undergo a tuberculosis (TB) test prior to study entry (either purified protein derivative [PPD] or QuantiFERON-TB Gold, whichever is preferred and available at the Institution); patients with a history of TB (even if treated), or evidence of active or latent TB, are excluded; the diagnosis of active TB is defined per current guidelines; patients with a positive TB test (e.g. PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold) will be excluded; patients with history of Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination will be tested with QuantiFERON-TB Gold test in order to rule out exposure to TB
Negative purified protein derivative (PPD) test
History of tuberculosis or history of tuberculosis skin test purified protein derivative (PPD) positivity
Presence of active infection; history of exposure to TB (positive purified protein derivative [PPD] or Quantiferon TB gold) who have not been treated with a TB prophylaxis regimen for at least one month
History of tuberculosis or positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test
History of tuberculosis or history of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) positivity
History of tuberculosis or purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test positivity
History of tuberculosis or history of purified protein derivative (PPD) positivity
Known prior history of tuberculosis or positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test result
History of tuberculosis or positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test
Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of active tuberculosis (this does not include a history of being purified protein derivative [PPD] positive)
Patients who are known purified protein derivative (PPD) positive will be screened for active tuberculosis prior to starting treatment with BCG
All participants must demonstrate a negative QuantiFERON (QFT) assay result within  weeks of transplant regardless of purified protein derivative (PPD) status; participants with a positive QFT assay must complete treatment for latent tuberculosis (TB) and have a negative chest x-ray; QFT testing done within  weeks before transplant is acceptable as long as there is documentation of the results; prior recipients of a bacillus calmette-guerin (BCG) vaccination are not exempt
All patients will have a tuberculin (purified protein derivative [PPD]) skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) done locally prior to the inclusion into the study. Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) will be excluded from the study.
