History of radiation to the chest wall or breast being studied
Unifocal malignant tumor that does not exceed mm in diameter and measures at least mm away from the skin and chest wall
Cluster of microcalcifications that do not exceed  mm in diameter and measures at least mm away from the skin and chest wall
Tumor invasion of the skin including dermis, chest wall, or pectoralis musculature
Pathologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer with clinical evidence of recurrent disease on the chest wall following treatment that included radiotherapy, and for which there is no current standard of care or curative resection able to be performed
Patients are permitted to have received prior therapy, but must have received a minimum of  Gy to the chest wall with a minimal interval since completion of radiation therapy equal to or greater than  months; patients who have previously received more than one course of radiotherapy to the breast and/or chest wall OR have received a cumulative dose to the chest wall in excess of  Gy will not be considered eligible
Prior radiotherapy to the ipsilateral chest wall for any malignancy.
Prior radiation to the chest wall or mediastinum if the radiation field involves the heart
Patients must have newly diagnosed metastatic disease; note this may include non-measurable chest wall recurrence
No evidence of disease outside the breast or chest wall, except ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes
No evidence of disease outside the breast or chest wall, except ipsilateral axillary or internal mammary lymph nodes
Histologically documented recurrent/metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast with a recurrence on the chest wall (or its overlying skin):
Subjects with ulcerative chest wall disease defined as non-healing wounds consistent with cancer are eligible.
One or more radiation treatment(s) to the chest wall or breast up to a maximum prior dose of , cGy in the hyperthermia field (not administered less than  days prior to enrollment).
Has a condition which may interfere with the hyperthermia portion of the trial such as: functioning cardiac pacemaker; metal plates, rods or prosthesis of the chest wall, breast reconstruction with implants, severe numbness and/or tingling of the chest wall or breast, skin grafts and/or flaps on the breast or chest wall.
