Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as organ or stem cell transplantation, any severe congenital or acquired cellular and/or humoral immune deficiency, concurrent opportunistic infection.
Significant immunosuppression from:
No autoimmune disorder that requires active immunosuppression
Absence of active GVHD and off immunosuppression; subjects on tapering prednisone will be eligible if their dose is . mg/kg or less and being actively tapered; we suggest a  day waiting period off of immunosuppression but some subjects with rapidly progressive disease may need to be treated before  days and will still be eligible
