Prior therapy\r\n* Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, high-dose therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment\r\n* Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens (a total of  cytotoxic regimens) for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the following definition:\r\n** Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinum-based regimen for management of primary disease), must have a platinum-free interval of less than  months, or have progressed during platinum-based therapy, or have persistent disease after a platinum-based therapy\r\n** Patients must NOT have received any non-cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease other than bevacizumab containing regimens; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic (non-cytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen
Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, high-dose therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment
PHASE I:\r\n* Patients must have received at least one course of platinum-based chemotherapy for the management of primary disease including carboplatin, cisplatin, or another platinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, biologic/targeted agents, or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment\r\n* There are no restrictions on the total number of prior regimens patients may have received
PHASE II:\r\n* Patients must have received at least one course of platinum-based chemotherapy for the management of primary disease including carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, biologic/targeted agents, or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment\r\n* There are no restrictions on the total number of prior regimens patients may have received
Participants must have had at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease (e.g., a regimen containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound); this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) agents (e.g., bevacizumab) or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment
Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents (biologic/targeted agents, such as bevacizumab) or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment; if patients were treated with paclitaxel for their primary disease, this can have been given weekly or every  weeks
Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) agents (e.g., bevacizumab) or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment
Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents (biologic/ targeted) or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment; if patients were treated initially with paclitaxel for their primary disease, this can have been given weekly or every  weeks; the most recent therapy and any therapies subsequent to initial therapy, however, cannot have contained weekly paclitaxel; if the immediate prior (most recent therapy) is the initial therapy, it may not have been with weekly paclitaxel
Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin or another organoplatinum compound; patients are also eligible if they received curative intent platinum-based therapy and progressed within a year of therapy
Patients must have had at least one prior platinum/taxane combination chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatin compound; this initial treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy, high dose therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic agents, or extended therapy
Prior therapy: patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organo-platinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents (including anti-angiogenesis agents) or extended therapy (i.e. maintenance therapy) administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment; maintenance therapy should not be longer than  months duration
Must have had ?  prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen containing carboplatin, cisplatin or another organoplatinum compound for management of primary disease. This initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal (IP) therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment.
