Corrected calcium value =< . x upper limit of normal (ULN)
Corrected calcium at or below ULN
Corrected calcium WNL
Patients must have corrected calcium and phosphate < upper limit or normal (ULN) obtained within  days prior to sub-study registration
Patients must have corrected calcium and phosphate < ULN obtained within  days prior to sub-study registration
Total calcium (corrected for serum calcium) =< ULN (or corrected to =< ULN with supplements prior to registration), obtained =<  days prior to registration
Corrected serum calcium ? ULN
Serum calcium (corrected for albumin level) =< x institutional ULN
Normal corrected calcium levels
Corrected calcium =< institutional ULN (corrected calcium = (- Albumin) x . + calcium)
Patient has a corrected serum calcium ?ULN.
Calcium within  x ULN
Participants must have serum calcium (corrected for albumin level) =<  x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)
