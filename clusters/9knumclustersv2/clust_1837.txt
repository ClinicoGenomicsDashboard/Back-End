Pts w/ osteopenia (T-score of - to -. at L/R total hip, L/R femoral neck or lumbar spine [L-L]) eligible

Patients with known osteopenia or osteoporosis.
Diagnosis of osteoporosis
History of severe osteoporosis (T score =< - either spine or hip), or presence of vertebral fracture
Diagnosed with osteoporosis
Severe osteoporosis
