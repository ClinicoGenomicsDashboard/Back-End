Other primary malignancy (EXCEPT adequately treated non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin, germ cell tumour, or other malignancy treated at least  years previously with no evidence of recurrence)
Second primary malignancy; exceptions are ) patient had a second primary malignancy but has been treated and disease free for at least  years, ) in situ carcinoma (e.g. in situ carcinoma of the cervix), ) non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin
Concurrent malignancy requiring therapy (excluding non-invasive carcinoma or\n             carcinoma in situ).
Concurrent malignancy requiring therapy (excluding non-invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ)
Patients with a second malignancy within the last  years are not allowed, except for those with non-melanomatous skin cancer and carcinoma-in-situ or the cervix; all prior invasive malignancies must be in complete remission
Any concurrent or previous malignancy within  years prior to randomization, except for adequately and radically treated basal or squamous skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other non-invasive/in-situ neoplasm.
Active second primary malignancy or history of second primary malignancy within the last  years, with the exception of basal cell skin cancers or carcinoma in situ that have been adequately treated
Participant has a concurrent active malignancy other than breast adenocarcinoma, adequately treated non melanomatous skin cancer, or other non-invasive carcinoma or in situ neoplasm. A participant with previous history of malignancy is eligible, provided that she has been disease free for >  years
Participant has had any other malignancy within  years prior to randomization, with the exception of adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, uterus, or nonmelanomatous skin cancer (all treatment of which should have been completed  months prior to enrollment).
History of another malignancy within  years prior to randomisation, except for either non- melanomatous carcinoma of the skin or, adequately treated, non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (Tis, Ta and low grade T tumours).
Second primary malignancy except most situ carcinoma (e.g. adequately treated non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin) or other malignancy completely resected with no recurrence
