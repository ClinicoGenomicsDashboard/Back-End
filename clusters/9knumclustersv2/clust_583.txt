Subjects who have progressed on Bevacizumab treatment
Patients who are pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or nursing. Use of effective means of contraception (men and women) in subjects of child-bearing potential. To date, no fetal studies in animals or humans have been performed. The possibility of harm to a fetus is likely. Bevacizumab specifically inhibits VEGF, which is responsible for formation of new blood vessels during development, and antibodies can cross the placenta. Therefore, bevacizumab should not be administered to pregnant women.
(continued from no. ) Subjects will be apprised of the large potential risk to a developing fetus. It is not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, bevacizumab should not be administered to nursing women. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use contraceptive measures during study therapy and for at least six months after completion of bevacizumab therapy.
