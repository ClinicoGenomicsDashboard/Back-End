Minimum interval since last major surgery (e.g. intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic), open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury is  weeks prior to registration; minimum interval since minor procedures, percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device is  week prior to registration; patients must have recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury prior to registration
SUB-PROTOCOL AIM A: Major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic) =<  weeks prior to registration or failure to recover from side effects of such surgery; exceptions: port placements, nephrectomy, tumor biopsies, and minor surgeries
Any surgery that is potentially hemorrhagic (e.g. intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or non-traumatic orthopedic surgery of the femur or pelvis) that is completed within  hours prior to first dose of study drug, or ongoing impairment of hemostasis as a result of one of these procedures
Patients within  days post major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic), open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury to avoid wound healing complications; minor procedures and percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device without complications require  hours prior to study entry
Prior systemic therapy, radiation therapy or intracavitary surgery (intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intracranial) within  days of starting study treatment
Patients who have undergone major surgery (e.g. intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury =<  weeks prior to starting study drug, or patients who have had minor procedures, percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device =<  week prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury
Major surgery (e.g. intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury =<  weeks and minor procedures (including percutaneous biopsies, placement of vascular access device, laparoscopy +/- biopsy) =<  week prior to starting study treatment; patients who have minor procedure(s) >  week prior to starting study treatment and have recovered from side effects of such procedure are eligible
Patient has had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic) within  weeks prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from side effects of such procedure; video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and patients can receive study treatment >=  week after these procedures
