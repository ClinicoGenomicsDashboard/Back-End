Asymptomatic serum amylase =< grade  and asymptomatic serum lipase =< grade ; patients with grade  or grade  serum amylase or lipase at the beginning of the study must be confirmed to have no signs and/or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g., elevated P-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.), at the screening visit
Asymptomatic serum amylase =<  x ULN; patients with > ULN but =<  x ULN serum amylase at study start must be confirmed to have no signs and/or symptoms suggestion pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g. elevated pancreatic [P]-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.)
CAPMATINIB INCLUSION CRITERIA: Serum amylase =< grade  and asymptomatic; patients with grade  or  serum amylase at the beginning of the study must be confirmed to have no signs and/or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g., elevated P-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.)
For patients being screened for Group , asymptomatic serum amylase > CTCAE Grade  (.-. x ULN). Patients with Grade  or Grade  serum amylase at the beginning of the study must be confirmed to have no signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g., elevated P-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.)
Asymptomatic serum amylase grade >  (.-. x ULN). Patients with grade  or grade  serum amylase at the beginning of the study must be confirmed to have no signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g., elevated P-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.)
Serum amylase or serum lipase CTCAE grade ?  with signs and/or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g. elevated P-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc)
