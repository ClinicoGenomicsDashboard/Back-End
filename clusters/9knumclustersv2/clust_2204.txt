Chemotherapy administered for adjuvant/neo adjuvant disease is acceptable provided it was administered at least  year prior to study entry.
Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for unresectable disease; patients with recurrence within  months of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy may be considered as having received one prior therapy for unresectable disease
Patients must be planning to receive one of the study-allowed regimens as their initial treatment for their current disease; myelosuppressive therapy must follow the standard regimen, although a dose reduction of up to % is permitted; this treatment may be neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy; patients must not be receiving or planning to receive concurrent radiation during systemic treatment
For participants who received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemo-radiation for urothelial carcinoma, a treatment-free interval more than (>)  months between the last treatment administration and the date of recurrence is required in order to be considered treatment naive in the metastatic setting
Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or recurrent (Stage IIIB not amenable for multimodality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC that is ALK-positive by an FDA-approved assay performed centrally. Patients must be ALK positive by local test prior to submitting tissue to the central lab. Randomization will occur after ALK positive confirmation is received from the central lab. Patients may have received up to  prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease, which may also include maintenance therapy. Note that patients that have received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and developed metastatic disease within  months from the end of that therapy would be considered to have received  prior regimen for metastatic disease.
