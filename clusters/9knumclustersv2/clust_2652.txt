Metastases with indistinct borders making targeting not feasible\r\n* NOTE: A potential issue with bone metastases is that they often are not discrete; since many patients on this protocol will have bone metastases, this will be an important issue; theoretically, Houndsfield units might provide an appropriate measure; however, a sclerotic lesion against dense cortical bone will not have a sharp demarcation based on Houndsfield units (HU); therefore, we acknowledge that such determinations will pose a challenge and thus the physicians judgment will be required
