For NSCLC, an ALK translocation must be detected by FISH in ? % of tumor cells.
In patients with diseases other than NSCLC, ALK translocation is not required and overexpression of ALK protein may be considered indicative of a genetic abnormality in ALK.
positive for the ALK fusion gene (test provided by a central laboratory)
Documented anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status.
Patients with EGFR- or ALK-positive disease are not eligible for this study
Patients with an Alk+ relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancy including but not limited to ALK+ ALCL or ALK+ large B cell lymphoma
No known presence of known EGFR or EML-ALK driver mutations in the tumor
Known sensitizing mutation in the EGFR gene or ALK fusion oncogene
Patients with NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous, or adenosquamous histopathology) must also meet the following criteria: a. Must have disease that is stage IIIB, not curable by surgery or radiotherapy, or stage IV; b. Must have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease; c. EGFR-positive or ALK-positive patients must have received at least one line of EGFR-directed or ALK-directed therapy, respectively; d. Must have received prior taxane therapy.
Chemotherapy naive NSCLC patients; for NSCLC patients with lung adenocarcinoma, tumors must be EGFR and ALK wild-type; if a KRAS mutation is detected, EGFR and ALK testing is not required
Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC that is EGFR Wild-type, ALK-negative rearrangement and ROS-negative rearrangement
Patients with histological- or cytological-confirmed, advanced unresectable breast, gastric, or non-small cell lung cancer, who have progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard anticancer therapy exists. a. Part C: Only the following subtype of tumors with the molecular/genetic alterations will be enrolled: HER positive MBC Advanced NSCLC, harboring EGFR mutations after progression on osimertinib Advanced NSCLC, harboring ALK translocations after treatment with alectinib or at least  ALK inhibitors
ALK positive NSCLC patients must either be treatment naive in the advanced setting or have had disease progression on or intolerance to at least  previous ALK inhibitor; ROS positive NSCLC patients must either be treatment naive in the advanced setting or have had disease progression on or intolerance to at least  previous ROS inhibitor
After progression on or intolerance to prior ALK or ROS inhibitor therapy:\r\n* A minimum washout period of at least  days between the last dose of ALK or ROS tyrosine kinase therapy (TKI) therapy and the first dose of study treatment is required; a shorter washout period may be considered in the event of disease flare, after discussion with the sponsor\r\n* Patients must have recovered from treatment toxicities to =< grade  or to their pretreatment levels except for adverse events (AEs) that in the investigators judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient
Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB (and is not a candidate for definitive multimodality therapy) or stage IV NSCLC demonstrated ALK-positive or an advanced tumor, other than NSCLC, that carries an ALK genetic alteration (mutation, translocation or amplification) and/or ALK overexpression that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy exists.
The test to confirm ALK-positivity may be performed in archival tumor (obtained at or since the time of diagnosis), or in a newly obtained tumor sample taken prior to the first day of study drug. Results confirming ALK-positive status must be available before initiating treatment with ceritinib.
