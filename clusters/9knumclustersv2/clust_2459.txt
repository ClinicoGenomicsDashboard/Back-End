An adverse prognosis, documented by persistent signs and symptoms of CD that have failed to respond satisfactorily to medical and surgical therapies in the past, including but not limited to systemic immune suppressive drugs and biopharmaceuticals; to be considered as refractory to medical and surgical therapy, there must be clinical, endoscopic, and histologic evidence of active inflammatory Crohn's Disease that has either persisted or recurred despite exhaustive treatment with available pharmaceutical and surgical therapies; exhaustive treatment is defined as prior exposure to the following, without durable improvement:\r\n* Systemic glucocorticoids at or above a prednisone equivalent of  mg/day for at least  weeks, or until drug toxicity or intolerance develops\r\n* Methotrexate ( mg per week for at least  months, or until drug toxicity or intolerance develops) and/or a thiopurine antimetabolite (either . mg/kg azathioprine or . mg/kg -mercaptopurine in patients homozygous wild-type for the thiopurine-S-methyltransferase [TPMT] gene, or either . mg/kg azathioprine or  mg/kg -mercaptopurine in patients heterozygous for TPMT, or doses of these drugs capable of producing a -thioguanine nucleotide level of - without producing a -methylmercaptopurine nucleotide level above  for at least  months, or until drug allergy, intolerance or toxicity develops); if a patient is homozygous mutant for the TPMT gene, thiopurines would be contraindicated and their use would not be a requirement for enrollment in this protocol\r\n* Use of at least two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapies, that is, infliximab (at least  mg/kg every  weeks for at least  months, or until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance or anti-infliximab antibodies develop) and/or adalimumab (at least  mg subcutaneously [SQ] every  weeks for at least  months, or until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance develops) and/or certolizumab pegol (at least  mg SQ every  weeks for at least  months, or until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance develops)\r\n* Due to the serious risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and the reluctance of some patients to agree to therapy that carries such risk, prior exposure to natalizumab is not required to meet the definition of exhaustive pharmaceutical treatment; neither will use of natalizumab among patients who are John Cunningham (JC) virus antibody seronegative be an exclusionary criterion\r\n* Exhaustive surgical treatment will be defined as indicated operations for complications of Crohn's Disease up to the point where the risks of surgery (for example, mortality or post-operative morbidity such as short bowel syndrome or extensive adhesions with high risk for inadvertent enterotomy) are deemed by patients and their physicians to be unacceptably high; indicated operations for complications of Crohn's Disease include, but are not limited to, surgical resection of involved intestine, stricturoplasty, drainage, curettage, or adhesiolysis of tissues affected by Crohn's disease\r\n* Exposure of patients to investigational drug therapies for Crohn's Disease, that is, to drugs that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this indication, will not be a criterion for either inclusion or exclusion
