Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate with systemic bone or node metastatic disease despite castrate levels of testosterone (<  ng/dL) due to orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist; castrate levels of testosterone must be maintained while on study; men can be enrolled prior to starting abiraterone and/or enzalutamide OR already be receiving treatment with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide
PROSTATE CANCER: Patients who are initiating any chemotherapy (examples are docetaxel, cabazitaxel, etc.) and/or hormone directed treatment for prostate cancer; examples of hormone directed therapy include gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonists (such as leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, histrelin and degarelix), androgen receptor blockers (such as bicalutamide or enzalutamide), or androgen biosynthesis inhibitors (such as abiraterone)
Second malignancies are allowed as long as the disease does not require active treatment with concomitant systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational or biologic therapy (e.g., anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein  [CTLA] or human epidermal growth factor receptor  [HER] monoclonal antibodies); hormone-related therapies (e.g., gonadotrophin releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, tamoxifen, etc.) are allowed
Receiving or planning to receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist
Arm  patients may not have received any prior luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists, antiandrogens, or chemotherapy for their prostate cancer; treatment with -alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride) are allowed
Have been previously diagnosed with a malignant solid tumor, completed their required surgical, and/or chemotherapy and/or radiation curative intent therapy at least three months prior to enrollment, and have an anticipated treatment-free life span of  months or longer; chemoprophylaxis with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer in women and anti-luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) therapy for prostate cancer in men will be permitted
Taking luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, androgen receptor blocking agents, finasteride, or has undergone bilateral orchiectomy
Documentation of menopausal status: postmenopausal subjects or pre-menopausal subjects with ovarian radiation or concomitant therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist/antagonist are eligible.
Have testosterone <  ng/dL; patients must continue primary androgen deprivation with an luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)/GnRH analogue (agonist or antagonist) if they have not undergone orchiectomy
Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); in addition, men receiving treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of testosterone by continuation of luteinizing-releasing hormone agonists
Treatment with chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or other investigational therapy within  weeks of first study doses; patients with non-adenocarcinoma of the prostate who may be on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist therapy may continue use
Hormone replacement therapy within the last  months
Note: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian suppression
Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (<  ng/dL) on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue or have had prior bilateral orchiectomy, with evidence of castration-resistant disease by Prostate Cancer Working Group  (PCWG) criteria
Primary or recurrent castration resistant prostate carcinoma with skeletal and/or nodal involvement not currently undergoing systemic chemotherapy who are about to commence therapy with docetaxel/prednisone; (note that systemic hormonal targeted therapy including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists [Lupron or Trelstar], other anti-androgens, and/or abiraterone or enzalutamide may be in use)
Men who have received any hormonal manipulation (antiandrogens; luteinizing hormone releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist; -alpha-reductase inhibitors) within the previous  months
The subject has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate with intermediate to high risk disease by University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) scoring and possesses a Gleason  component to the tumor; subjects will be enrolled either prior to radical prostatectomy (N=) or prior to initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist +/- antiandrogen) followed by definitive radiation therapy as their primary treatment for prostate cancer (N=)
Patients may receive no other concurrent anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy (except for prostate cancer patients on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ((LHRH)) agonists), immunotherapy, biological agents, investigational agents, or radiation therapy during this trial, and should be off these treatments for at least  weeks, or until they have completely recovered from the side effects of these treatments, whichever is longest, except for persistent grade  neuropathy in patients who received prior platinum or taxanes.
Premenopausal women will be considered eligible for study participation if they are receiving medical ovarian suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists with documented estradiol blood levels in their respective postmenopausal ranges.
Hormonal therapy (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or oral anti-androgen) exceeding  months prior to registration
