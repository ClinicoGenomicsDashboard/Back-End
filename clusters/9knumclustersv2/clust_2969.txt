Histologic diagnosis of CD-positive classical HL as defined by the  World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Hematological diseases; nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is not eligible
Patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL
Histologically confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (excluding nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, with hematopathology review at the participating institution
Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma including nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocytic-rich, and lymphocyte depleted subtypes by the th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues published in  (nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma [NLPHL] excluded)
Participants with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)
Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkins lymphoma subtype
Has a diagnosis of lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)
PHASE IB DOSE EXPANSION: Histologically confirmed classical or lymphocyte predominant Hodgkins disease
Lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma
DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n          -  Diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma\n\n               -  Stage IA or IIA disease\n\n        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n          -  Not specified\n\n        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\n          -  No prior therapy
Patients with low risk (stage IA or IIA) nodular lymphocyte predominant histology
All patients must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) as outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system of lymphoid tumors; patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL) are not eligible
Subjects with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma
Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma
Histologically documented classical or nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkins lymphoma that is recurrent or refractory after standard chemotherapy; core biopsies are acceptable if they contain adequate tissue for primary diagnosis and immunophenotyping; bone marrow biopsies as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable
Patients with Hodgkins lymphoma may have one of the following World Health Organization subtypes:\r\n* Nodular sclerosis Hodgkins lymphoma\r\n* Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkins lymphoma\r\n* Mixed cellularity Hodgkins lymphoma\r\n* Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkins lymphoma\r\n* Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkins lymphoma
Previously untreated classical Hodgkin lymphoma (i.e., nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte depleted, lymphocyte-rich, and not otherwise specified [NOS]); nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is not eligible
Core biopsies are acceptable if they contain adequate tissue for primary diagnosis and immunophenotyping; if the original diagnostic specimen is not available, relapsed or refractory specimens may be used; bone marrow biopsies as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable; however, they may be used in conjunction with nodal biopsies; fine needle aspirates (FNA) are not acceptable; pathology reports must be submitted with the appropriate case report forms (CRFs), and the actual biopsy specimens are not requested for central review; patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) have one of the following World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes:\r\n* Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma\r\n* Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma\r\n* Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma\r\n* Lymphocyte-deplete Hodgkin lymphoma\r\ncHL patients without one of these subtypes designated cHL not otherwise specified are also eligible\r\nNOTE: patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL are not eligible
Histologically documented Hodgkin lymphoma subclassified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) modification of the Rye Classification and staged according to the modified Ann Arbor Staging Classification system; patients must have clinical stage IA, IB, IIA or IIB; patients with E extensions will be eligible if all other criteria have been met; nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is excluded
Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma may have one of the following World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes:\r\n* Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma\r\n* Mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma\r\n* Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin's lymphoma\r\n* Lymphocyte-deplete Hodgkin's lymphoma\r\n* Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma
Lymphocyte predominant histology
Subjects with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL
Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma including nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocytic-rich, and lymphocyte depleted subtypes by the th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues published in
