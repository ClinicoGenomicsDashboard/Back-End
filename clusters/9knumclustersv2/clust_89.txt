Phase II part: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with at least one measurable lesion as determined by RECIST version ., who have progressed following their last prior therapy, and fit into one of the following groups:
Presence of at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version (v).; a previously irradiated site lesion may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the completion of irradiation
Subjects must have at least one measurable target lesion according to RECIST version (v).
Patients with at least one baseline measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria version ..
At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version (v). criteria; previously irradiated lesions are not measurable unless the lesion has demonstrated clear progression after radiation
Have at least one measurable lesions in the liver or at least one measurable lesion in the liver and another measurable lesion elsewhere, based on RECIST version (v.) .
Radiographically measurable disease by RECIST version . in at least one site not previously treated with chemoembolization, radioembolization, radiation, or other local/liver-directed procedures (i.e. must have at least one measurable target lesion, either within the liver or in a measurable metastatic site); a new area of tumor progression within or adjacent to a previously-treated lesion, if clearly measurable by a radiologist, is acceptable
Has at least one measurable lesion per RECIST version ..
At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version .; previously irradiated lesions are not measurable unless the lesion has demonstrated clear progression after radiation
At least one measurable lesion based on RECIST version .
FULL STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients must have at least  measurable lesion according to RECIST version (v) .
PHASE II: At least one measurable extra-CNS lesion based upon RECIST version .; Note: participants with at least one CNS lesion >=  mm but no other measurable extra-CNS lesions will still be allowed to participate
At least one radiologically measurable target lesion per RECIST version .
Patient has either measurable disease per RECIST v. or at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion must be present
For escalation cohorts, if no measurable disease is present, then at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion must be present
Radiographically measurable disease by RECIST version . in at least one site not previously treated with chemoembolization, radioembolization, or other local ablative procedures (i.e. must have at least one measurable target lesion, either within the liver or in a measurable metastatic site); a new area of tumor progression within or adjacent to a previously-treated lesion, if clearly measurable by a radiologist, is acceptable
Patient has either measurable disease per RECIST . criteria OR at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion must be present
At least one extra-renal measurable target lesion meeting the criteria of RECIST version .
Disease must be measurable with at least  uni-dimensional measurable lesion by RECIST Version . (including skin lesions)
At least  target lesion that is unirradiated and measurable by RECIST, Version .
Patient must have either measurable disease by RECIST . or at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion.
Patient must have either measurable disease or If no measurable disease is present, then at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion
Subjects must have at least  measurable lesion based on RECIST version ..
At least  target lesion that is measurable by RECIST, Version .
At least  target lesion that is measurable by RECIST, Version .
If no measurable disease is present, then at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion must be present
Subject must have at least  unidimensional measurable NSCLC lesion on a CT scan as defined by RECIST (version .).
Patient must have either:  Measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST . criteria (Tumor lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other locoregional therapy will only be considered measurable if disease progression at the treated site after completion of therapy is clearly documented). OR  If no measurable disease is present, then at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion must be present (Patients with no measurable disease and only one predominantly lytic bone lesion that has been previously irradiated are eligible if there is documented evidence of disease progression of the bone lesion after irradiation).
Presence of at least  measurable lesion according to RECIST version .
At least one measurable lesion as defined by modified RECIST version .; previously irradiated lesions are not measurable unless the lesion is new or has demonstrated clear progression after radiation
At least one measurable lesion by CT scan or MRI based on RECIST version .
Have on CT imaging done within  days of Day  findings consistent with advanced ccRCC, including at least one extra-renal measurable target lesion meeting the criteria of RECIST version ..
Measurable disease, as determined by radiologist evaluator, with at least  unidimensional measurable lesion (target lesion) by RECIST v.. that has not previously been irradiated or biopsied
At least one lesion measurable by RECIST Version ..
At least  unresectable lesion on a CT (Computerized Tomography) scan that is measurable as defined by RECIST, Version .
Measurable disease (i.e., present with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST, version .).
Patients with measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by modified RECIST version . in dose-escalation phase, and patients with at least one measurable lesion as determined by RECIST . in expansion phase.
Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version .. Palpable lesions that are not measurable by radiographic or photographic evaluations may not be utilized as the only measurable lesion. Any measurable lesion biopsied at Screening cannot be followed as a target/index lesion unless agreed upon by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
Has at least one measurable lesion per RECIST version .
