A QTc interval of > msec by the Fridericia formula (QTcF), at the Screening ECG. If the subject's QTcF is > msec on the initial ECG, a total of  ECGs should be obtained at least  minutes apart and all within  minutes. The average of the  QTcF's will be used to determine eligibility. Known or suspected causes of prolonged QTc can be treated (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesimia) and the ECGs may be repeated. If the subject initiates treatment with a drug known to prolong the QTc during the Screening period after the initial Screening ECGs were obtained, the Screening ECGs must be repeated once the new drug has reached steady state to ensure the average QTcF remains ? msec. For subject's whose heart rate is < bpm, the Bazett correction formula (QTcB) may be used.
Subjects with a QTcF interval of > msec; if the Screening ECG QTcF interval is > msec, it may be repeated, and if repeat < msec, the subject may be enrolled.
