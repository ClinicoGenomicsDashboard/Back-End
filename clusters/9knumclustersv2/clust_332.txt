Participants having greater than + proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo -h urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein greater than or equal to  g/-hour will be ineligible.
Participants with proteinuria >+ on urinalysis will undergo -hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein ? g/ hour will be ineligible.
Measurable disease M protein component in serum (at least . g/dL) and/or urine (if present) (>=. g excreted in a  hour collection sample).
Documented baseline proteinuria >  mg/day on  hour urine collection; only patients with + or greater proteinuria on urinalysis (UA) and a spot urine protein: creatinine ratio of > . will undergo a  hour urine collection for quantitation of proteinuria
Subjects having > + proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo  hours (h) urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria; subjects with urine protein >=  g/h will be ineligible
If uPCR ? . then a -hour urine collection can be performed to qualify. If this is performed to qualify, the protein result must be <  g per  hours.
>  mg/dL on urine analysis; patients with >  mg/dL on urine analysis on urine analysis will undergo -hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria; subjects with -hour protein >=  g/ hours will be ineligible
Urinalysis: for patients with + proteinuria on urinalysis,  hour urine collection should be obtained;  hour urine protein should be <  grams
If urinalysis shows proteinuria,  hour urine collection is to be performed and the  hour urine protein is to be <  grams to be eligible
In patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma, screening urinalysis required prior to study enrollment; if random collection urine specimen is positive for proteinuria, patients must have -hour urine protein determination; patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma are excluded if -hour urine protein is above the institutional upper limit of normal
If there is proteinuria present on dipstick, patients must have a  hour urine collection; patients are excluded if they have >  mg protein on  hour urine collection
Participants having >  + proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo  hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein ?  gram/ hours will be ineligible.
Proteinuria at screening demonstrated by urine analysis (UA) > + and  hour urine protein >=  gram/ hours
Subjects having greater than + proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo a -hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with a urine protein greater than or equal to  g/ hours will be ineligible.
Persistent renal involvement from diagnosis with proteinuria (predominantly albumin) > mg/day in a -hour urine collection
Clinically significant proteinuria: \r\n* Subjects having > + proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo -hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria; subjects with urine protein >=  g/-hour will be ineligible
Palliative radiation that does not include a target lesion is allowed. Subjects having a spot urine protein:creatinine ratio of >  will undergo -hour collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. If urine protein >  gram/ hours, the subject will be ineligible
Subjects having greater than + proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo -hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with urine protein greater than or equal to  g/-hour will be ineligible.
Patients with proteinuria on screening urinalysis confirmed to be >  g/ hr by  hour urine collection
Participants with urine protein ? gram/ hour
Measurable disease M component in serum (? . g/dL) and/or urine (? . g excreted in a  hour collection sample)
Participants having >+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo  hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein ? grams (g)/ hours will be ineligible.
If applicable, must be willing to collect a urine specimen and bring to the clinic; depending on specific planned uses, this may be a -hour collection, a -hour fasting collection, or a first morning collection
Participants must have a -hour calcium concentration that is =<  mg/ hours as measured by -hour urine collection at baseline
- Proteinuria <  g/ hours based upon  hour urine collection or spot urine protein/creatinine ratio
- Proteinuria <  g/ hours based upon  hour urine collection or spot urine protein/creatinine ratio
Participants having >+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo -hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine protein ? g/ h will be ineligible.
