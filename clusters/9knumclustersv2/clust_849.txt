Patients with evidence of chronic active Hepatitis B (positive for HbsAg) and Hepatitis C (positive for viral RNA).
Patients must have no evidence of significant hematologic, renal, or hepatic dysfunction; patients with underlying hepatocellular disease should be given careful risk/benefit consideration prior to enrollment; patients with a history of any chronic hepatitis as evidenced by the following are ineligible:\r\n* Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)\r\n* Positive test for qualitative hepatitis C viral load (by PCR) (Note: subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody and negative quantitative hepatitis C by PCR are eligible; history of resolved hepatitis A virus infection is not an exclusion criterion)\r\n* History of alcoholic or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), auto-immune hepatitis, or previous grade - drug-related hepatitis, or any form of chronic liver disease
Known to be positive for HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C
Participant with a positive diagnosis of hepatitis A, B, or C.
Patients with a known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C

Subjects must not have a history of any positive test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C indicating active disease or previous exposure
True positive test results for hepatitis A, B, or C during screening
Patients who are hepatitis B or C positive
Patients with a known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C are not eligible
Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, positive hepatitis B tests can be further evaluated by confirmatory tests, and if confirmatory tests are negative, the patient can be enrolled; patients with a known history of hepatitis B are not eligible
History of renal or hepatic disease, including history of hepatitis B or C
Patients tested positive for hepatitis B or with a known, active hepatitis C infection
Patients with a known history of hepatitis B or C

Positive Hepatitis C test result at screening or within  months prior to first dose of study treatment.
Patients who are Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C antibody positive.
Patients known to be HIV positive, hepatitis B positive, or hepatitis C positive.
Positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C Ribonucleic acid (RNA) test result at screening or within  months prior to first dose of study treatment. Subjects with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA test is obtained.
Positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C RNA test result at Screening or within  months prior to first dose of study treatment. NOTE: Subjects with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA test is obtained.
Patients known to be HIV positive, hepatitis B positive, or hepatitis C positive.
Known history of or positive test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.
Known HIV-, hepatitis B-, or hepatitis C-positive patients (active, previously treated, or both)
Has known history of or is positive for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C
History of hepatitis (B or C)
Positive Hepatitis C antibody test
Hepatitis B or C positive
mother known to have hepatitis B
Known history of or is positive for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C
Patients with history of untreated hepatitis B or who are known carriers of hepatitis B will be excluded from this trial; all subjects will be screened prior to study entry
History of hepatitis B or C
All patients known to be positive for hepatitis B will be excluded from the study, and those at high risk for hepatitis B infection will be screened
History of interstitial lung disease, prior malignancy, active autoimmune disease, positive test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus
Patients with a known history of liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, or hepatitis B or C are not eligible for participation
Patients with known hepatitis or unstable liver disease, and/or positive serologies for Hepatitis B or C and HIV.
Known positive patients for infectious hepatitis, type A, B, C
Has a known history of Hepatitis B
Seropositivity or DNA/RNA positivity for hepatitis B or C, with the exception of patients who have received prior Hepatitis B vaccination and are Anti-HBs positive only
Tested positive for HIV or hepatitis.
Current or known history of hepatitis
Has known history of or is positive for hepatitis B or hepatitis C
Positive for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV
HIV positivity (NOTE: patients positive for hepatitis B or hepatitis C are not excluded, and may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis)
History of any hepatitis (A,B or C)
History of any hepatitis (A, B or C)
History of grade - drug-related hepatitis
Positive for hepatitis BsAg or HIV Ab or hepatitis C
A Hepatitis B/C blood test must be done at screening for all patients; patients who test positive for Hepatitis C antibodies and the Hepatitis B antigen are ineligible
Known positive hepatitis with evidence of active disease
Patients with known history of autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis C or those with hemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia)
History of hepatitis A, B and C
Evidence of any active uncontrolled infection (bacterial, viral or fungal) or evidence of natural exposure to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); evidence of hepatitis B exposure includes the presence of hepatitis B surface antigenemia, a positive serological test for hepatitis B core antibody or nucleic acid testing (NAT testing) that is positive for hepatitis B; vaccination to hepatitis B is not an exclusion criteria; testing done in the pre-transplant setting is sufficient to rule out infection
Patient is known to be hepatitis B or hepatitis C-positive (these tests are not required)
Known history of infection with HIV, hepatitis B (HBsAg positive), or hepatitis C (anti-HCV positive). A history of treated hepatitis B or hepatitis C is permitted if the viral load is undetectable per quantitative PCR and/or nucleic acid testing.
