No prior chemotherapy for the treatment of mCRPC; patients may have received docetaxel for the treatment of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer
Patients who are deemed to have high-risk or extensive metastatic, hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) per clinical judgment of the treating physician are eligible for enrollment if they are unsuitable candidates for docetaxel or if they have declined docetaxel therapy
Prior chemotherapy (for example, docetaxel, cabazitaxel) for treatment of CRPC, except when docetaxel has been given for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer
For Cohort B: Has received prior treatment with docetaxel or another chemotherapy agent for metastatic prostate cancer
For Cohort C: Has received prior chemotherapy for mCRPC. Prior docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is allowed if ? weeks elapsed from last dose of docetaxel
Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer, but up to  cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic disease is permitted.
The subject has had treatment with docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer within  months before the first dose of study treatment
The subject has had progression of prostate cancer during  cycles of prior docetaxel treatment for castrate sensitive disease
Prior docetaxel or other chemotherapy for mCRPC; patients who have received docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer are eligible
Patients who have received docetaxel plus anti-androgen therapy (ADT) for metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer are eligible for the study; (patients may enroll as long as they did not have progressive disease while on docetaxel and are  months removed from treatment, with all treatment related toxicities resolving to at least grade )
Have had treatment with docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer within  months before the first dose of study enrollment
Have had progression of prostate cancer on prior docetaxel treatment for castrate sensitive disease
