DONOR: Related donors with at least a haplotype at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci that is shared with the recipient by high resolution typing, excluding an identical twin or unrelated donors matched -/ at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing
HSCT Donor will be one of the following:\r\n* / or / (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-A, B, DR) matched related donor\r\n* / or / (HLA-A, B, DR, C) matched unrelated donor. Matching in the unrelated setting must be at the allele level\r\n* Haploidentical related donor, defined as ? / (HLA-A, B, DR) matched\r\n* >= / (HLA-A, B, DR) umbilical cord blood (UCB). Matching in the UCB setting is at the antigen level. Recipients may receive either one or two UCB units. In the case of  UCB units, both units must have been at least / matched with the recipient
DONOR: Arm A: All candidates for this study must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (A, B, C, and DR) identical sibling who is willing to donate primed blood stem cells (preferred) or bone marrow, or have a / (A, B, C, DR and DQ) allele matched unrelated donor; DQ or DP mismatch is allowed per discretion of the principal investigator
All candidates for this study must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (A, B, C, DR) identical sibling who is willing to donate primed blood stem cells (preferred) or bone marrow, or have a / allele matched unrelated donor; all ABO blood group combinations of the donor/recipient are acceptable
Participants who will undergo HCT from the following donor types are eligible:\r\n* / or / (HLA-A, B, DR) matched related donor\r\n* / or / (HLA-A, B, DR, C) matched unrelated donor. Matching in the unrelated setting must be at the allele level
All candidates for this study must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (A, B, C, DR) identical siblings who is willing to donate bone marrow for primed blood stem cells or an / allele-matched unrelated donor
DONOR: Donors must match at least one allele of HLA-A, B, C, DR and DP (or permissive mismatch in the case of DP) by high resolution typing; a HLA-matched family member is ineligible to serve as a donor; eligible donors include biological parents, siblings, half-siblings or children
Availability of an / matched donor at A, B, C, and DR loci; mismatch at human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ are permissible; matched related or unrelated donors are acceptable; peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cells are acceptable
All candidates for this study must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (A, B, C, DR) identical siblings who is willing to donate bone marrow or primed blood stem cells or a / allele matched unrelated donor; a single allele mismatch at A, B, C, DR or DQ and a killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatch at C will be allowed; all ABO blood group combinations of the donor/recipient are acceptable
MATCHED RELATED DONOR: Related donor matched at / or / HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing 
Patient must have an identified HLA (A,B,C,DR) compatible related or unrelated donor who is age  years of age or older and weighs at least  pounds for the stem cell donation
Patients must have a related donor who is at least a -/ antigen mismatch at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A; B; C; DR loci; patients with only a  out of  mismatch in the GVH direction will be classified in the matched related category
MATCHED RELATED DONOR: Related donors matched at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing (/ antigen/allele match) are acceptable donors; alternatively, a / matched related donor can be used
MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated donor matched at / or / HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing
The unrelated cord blood donor(s) must be -/ human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, DRB matched with the recipient (HLA matching using molecular techniques: A and B to antigen level resolution and DR to allele level resolution)
DONOR: HLA-genotypically or phenotypically  to  antigen mismatched (at the A, B, DR loci) related donors will be acceptable
Recipient of mismatched (allele or antigen level) graft in more than one loci of HLAA, -B, -C or DR loci will not be eligible, i.e. recipients of -antigen or -allelele mismatched graft
Histocompatible stem cell donor: patients must have an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related or unrelated donor (HLA A, B, C and DR) willing to donate for allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation; high resolution allele level typing is required for donors other than genotypically identical siblings
MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated donor matched at HLA-A, B, C, and DR loci by high resolution typing (at / or / antigen/allele match) are acceptable donors
Related or unrelated donor which is HLA-matched or mismatched in  HLA A, B, C, DR, or DQ locus is acceptable (i.e. >= / matched related or unrelated donor, matched with molecular high-resolution technique per current standard [std.] for bone marrow transplant [BMT] program); cord blood units must match patient at , , or / HLA class  serological & II molecular antigens with a minimum (min.) of  x ^ total number of nucleated cells (TNC)/kg recipient weight in the pre-thawed fraction; for patient lacking a matched related or unrelated donor or acceptable cord blood unit(s), a related haploidentical donor (=< / allele matched at A, B, C, DR loci) may be used
Patients must have a related donor who is a two or more allele mismatch at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A; B; C; DR and DQ loci; patients who have sibling donors with a one antigen mismatch due to recombination will not be enrolled in this protocol
Patients of Dr. Gonzalez
All candidates for this study must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (A, B, C, DR) identical siblings who is willing to donate bone marrow or primed blood stem cells or an / allele-matched unrelated donor
 out of  at high resolution using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based typing with either antigen or allele mismatched HLA (-A, -B, -C, and -DR) or / HLA-mismatched with either double DQ mismatch (/) or combined DQ and DP mismatch
Per Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) bone marrow transplant (BMT) program practices, an allele level matched (/ human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, C and DR) sibling or unrelated donor is preferred; if a matched donor is not found, mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donors may be considered
