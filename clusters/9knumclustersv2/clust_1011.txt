Subject has current central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases or history of CNS or leptomeningeal metastases.
Leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Known leptomeningeal or brainstem metastases. The presence of leptomeningeal enhancement alone, without associated clinical manifestations and/or positive CSF cytology, will not be constituted as known leptomeningeal metastases
Known leptomeningeal or brainstem metastases (defined as positive CSF cytology and/or unequivocal radiological evidence of clinically significant leptomeningeal involvement; CSF sampling is not required in the absence of suggestive symptoms to exclude leptomeningeal involvement)
Leptomeningeal metastases
Presence of leptomeningeal metastases
Diffuse Leptomeningeal metastases with radiographic involvement in the brain and/or spinal cord. This does not include local leptomeningeal involvement which is defined as leptomeningeal enhancement within direct contact of targetable metastases
Subjects with leptomeningeal metastases in lumbar area.
History of leptomeningeal metastases
Active leptomeningeal metastases
Patients with leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Must not have leptomeningeal metastases.
Leptomeningeal metastases
Participants in Part F must have HR+ breast cancer, NSCLC, or melanoma with leptomeningeal metastases.
For Parts A, B, C, D, E: Have evidence of leptomeningeal metastases. Note: discrete dural metastases are permitted.
Evidence of leptomeningeal metastases
Participant has known leptomeningeal metastases.
Evidence of leptomeningeal metastases
Active CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease.
CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease requiring immediate treatment with radiation therapy or steroids.
Patients with known or suspected leptomeningeal metastases.
Known leptomeningeal metastases not amenable to radiotherapy; patients receiving radiotherapy for leptomeningeal metastases are eligible
Known leptomeningeal metastases
History of leptomeningeal metastases
Those with leptomeningeal metastases as the only site of CNS disease
Patients with leptomeningeal metastases
Symptomatic CNS metastases or evidence of leptomeningeal disease.
Known brain metastases (unless asymptomatic and treated) or leptomeningeal metastases, including suspected leptomeningeal spread with positive cytology
Presence of leptomeningeal disease or dural metastases.
Leptomeningeal metastases, hemorrhagic metastases, presence of midline shift; please note: leptomeningeal metastases may be allowed if it is limited to cranial metastasis (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] spine should be completed, within  weeks of enrollment, to show that no other leptomeningeal metastases is present) and is not the only metastasis present in the brain
Evidence of CNS or leptomeningeal metastases
History of leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Patients with definitive leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases; please note: leptomeningeal metastases may be allowed if it is limited to cranial metastasis (MRI spine should be completed, within  weeks of enrollment, to show that no other leptomeningeal metastases is present) and is not the only metastasis present in the brain
