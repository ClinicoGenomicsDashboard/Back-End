No presence of cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia
Significant cardiac event (eg, myocardial infarction), New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease >=  within  weeks before starting treatment, or presence of cardiac disease that in the opinion of the Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia
Presence of cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia
History of myocardial infarction within  months with a residual arrhythmia that in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia
Significant cardiac event (e.g., myocardial infarction), superior vena cava syndrome, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease >=  within  weeks, or presence of cardiac disease that in the opinion of the investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia
History of any significant cardiac event (e.g. myocardial infarction), superior vena cava syndrome, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease >=  within  weeks before starting treatment, or presence of cardiac disease that in the opinion of the Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia
Clinically significant cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, superior vena cava syndrome [SVC], New York Heart Association [NYHA] classification of heart disease >=  within  months before entry); or presence of cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia
Patients must not have had a clinically significant cardiac event within  months before entry; or the presence of any other uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.
