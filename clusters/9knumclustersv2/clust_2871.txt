DONOR: If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class I locus or II locus, the donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must match the patient (i.e., patient is homozygous A*: and donor is heterozygous A*:, A*:); this mismatch will be considered a one-antigen mismatch for rejection only
DONOR: Patients who are homozygous at the mismatched HLA class I locus or II locus, the donor is excluded if homozygous at the mismatched locus (i.e., patient is homozygous A*: and donor is homozygous A*:); this type of mismatch is considered a two-antigen mismatch and is not allowed
DONOR: Donor-recipient pairs in which the HLA-mismatch is only in the host-versus-graft (HVG) direction; patients are homozygous and donor is heterozygous
DONOR: Patient and donor pairs must not be homozygous at mismatched allele
DONOR: Patients who are homozygous at the mismatched HLA class I or II locus, the donor is excluded if homozygous at the mismatched locus (i.e., patient is homozygous A *: and donor is homozygous A *:); this type of mismatch is considered a two-antigen mismatch and is not allowed
HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for patients with  of  HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before HCT; if the PRA shows > % activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion
HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A* and the donor is A*, and this type of mismatch is not allowed
HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class I locus or II locus, the donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must match the patient (i.e., patient is homozygous A*: and donor is heterozygous A*:, A*:); this mismatch will be considered a one-antigen mismatch for rejection only
