Cranial MRI or contrast CT must have been performed within  days of study entry; the use of MRI rather than CT is preferred; the same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT, must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement; if the surgical procedure was a resection, cranial MRI or contrast CT performed within  hours of resection is preferred, but not required; patients without measureable or assessable disease are eligible
Appropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup:\r\n* History/physical examination within  days prior to registration;\r\n* Imaging of the primary tumor by MRI and/or computed tomography (CT) with and without contrast and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT within  days prior to registration;\r\n* Staging workup evaluated by chest CT and/or PET/CT showing no distant metastasis within  days prior to registration
Patients must have borderline resectable pancreatic cancer with no metastatic spread as determined by a baseline diagnostic CT scan with intravenous contrast (or MRI). CT should be performed according to a defined pancreas protocol such as triphasic cross-sectional imaging with thin slices. Optimal multi-phase technique including a non-contrast phase plus arterial, pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phase of contrast enhancement with thin cuts (mm) throughout the abdomen is preferred. Studies must be evaluated by a radiologist and/or surgeon and deemed borderline resectable as defined below:
Appropriate stage for protocol entry, including no distant metastases, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup:\r\n* History/physical examination, including recording of pulse, blood pressure (BP), weight, and body surface area, within  days prior to registration\r\n* Whole body fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT (orbits to mid-thighs) within  days prior to registration; PET/CT must be negative for distant metastasis\r\n* CT scan with contrast of the chest and upper abdomen to include liver and adrenals (unless medically contraindicated) within  days prior to registration\r\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast (or CT scan with contrast, if MRI medically contraindicated) within  days prior to registration
No evidence of metastatic disease as determined by chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and abdominal CT scan (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with gadolinium and/or manganese); all patients must be staged with a physical exam, chest CT, abdominal CT with intravenous contrast (or abdominal MRI with gadolinium and/or manganese)

Stage clinical T N M or T N M as per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging system th edition, based on the following criteria:\r\n* Chest computed tomography (CT) with upper abdomen to include the liver and adrenal glands with intravenous (IV) contrast (unless medically contraindicated) within  months of registration\r\n* Participants must have measurable disease, defined as >=  mm on a diagnostic CT scan with slice thickness of no more than . mm\r\n* Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan including neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis within  months of study enrollment characterizing the primary tumor and documenting the absence of nodal and distant metastasis\r\n* Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium within  months of study enrollment demonstrating the absence of brain metastasis; if an MRI is medically contraindicated or if the patient refuses, a head CT with IV contrast is acceptable
