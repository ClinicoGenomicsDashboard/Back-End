Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines
Newly diagnosed neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma as verified by histology and/or demonstration of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites
Diagnosis of neuroblastoma as defined per International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria
Evidence of neuroblastoma outside osteomedullary sites (any neuroblastoma outside osteomedullary sites must have been removed prior to trial entry)
The target tumor is limited to neuroblastoma; patients must have had histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines at the time of initial diagnosis
Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma verified at diagnosis, or at the time of relapse by histology and/or demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites; patients with non-neuroblastic MIBG avid tumors are also eligible including but not limited to paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma
Patient must have a documentation of prior diagnosis of NB or ganglioneuroblastoma either by histologic verification and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased catecholamine levels
Diagnosed with neuroblastoma either by histological verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines
Histologic proof of neuroblastoma or positive bone marrow for tumor cells with increased urine catecholamines
Relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma with original diagnosis based on tumor histopathology or elevated urine catecholamines with typical neuroblastoma cells in the bone marrow
Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines
Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines
Patients must have stage  high-risk neuroblastoma or metastatic neuroblastoma (not S)
Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines
Patients must have had histologic verification of neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma or demonstration of neuroblastoma cells in the bone marrow with elevated urinary catecholamines (i.e., >  x upper limit of normal [ULN]), at the time of initial diagnosis
Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines.
Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamines.
Diagnosis of neuroblastoma as defined by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS)
Disease Status: Neuroblastoma that is in remission
Disease Status: Neuroblastoma that is in remission
Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow with increased urinary catecholamine metabolites
