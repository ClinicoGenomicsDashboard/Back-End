Histologically confirmed inoperable advanced adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum
Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the colon; the gross inferior (caudad) margin of the primary tumor must lie above the peritoneal reflection (i.e., patients with rectal cancer are not eligible); surgeon confirmation that the entire tumor was above the peritoneal reflection is only required in cases where it is important to establish if the tumor is a rectal or colon primary
Colon cancer other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., sarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoid).
Prior history of invasive adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum.
colon cancer
Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum that is either metastatic, or locally advanced and unresectable; NOTE: in the event that both cecal and appendiceal primaries are considered, patient is eligible if it is concluded by the treating oncologist to most likely be cecal based on pathological, surgical, and clinical interpretation

Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum.
Colon wall involvement
Participants must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum that is metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable); patients with resected primary tumors who have documented metastases are eligible; documentation of residual disease by computed tomography (CT) scan or surgeons notes is required for all patients, and histologic confirmation of metastases is strongly encouraged
Diagnosis of phenotypic classical FAP with disease involvement of the duodenum and/or colon/rectum/pouch.
Patients with an intact colon/rectum, except for clinical polyposis, and prophylactic surgery is being considered as a stratification site.
Colon/rectum/pouch with high grade dysplasia or cancer on biopsy or a large polyp (> cm) not amenable to complete removal.
Histological or cytological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum
Has previously undergone a left sided colon resection.
Histological or pathologically confirmed stage IV adenocarcinoma of the colon.
Histologically confirmed colon or rectal cancer with metastatic disease
Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum that is metastatic.
Have a history of a primary adenocarcinoma of the colon and / or rectum
Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions which might affect the radiated colon or rectum
Phase Ib: Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, colon or rectum which disease is advanced (defined as not surgically curable) or metastatic in whom combination treatment using fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan is a rational option
Eligible patients must have been diagnosed with colon or rectal adenocarcinoma
Diagnosis of stage I-III cancers of the rectosigmoid colon or rectum
colon cancer: - prior treatments
Have been diagnosed with stage I-III colon or rectal adenocarcinoma
Carry a diagnosis of metastatic colon, rectum, or small bowel adenocarcinoma
Patient with prior history of colon cancer

Participants must have endoscopically accessible distal colon and/or rectal mucosa (i.e. participants must have at least part of the descending/sigmoid colon and/or rectum intact).
Individuals who are status post total proctocolectomy (i.e. removal of all colon and rectum).
Cytologically or histologically confirmed of primary colon or rectal adenocarcinoma with resectable cancer, who have not received any treatments for cancer
Known diagnosis of stage III colon or rectal cancer will be excluded from the study

Have histologically confirmed solid malignancy including but not limited to: pancreas, lung, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, breast, ovary, renal or lymphoma (hematologic), with locally advanced or metastatic disease
Pathology proven diagnosis of colon or colorectal carcinoma.
Participants must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon that is localized, with no evidence of distant metastasis (stage I, II, or III), and for which surgical resection of the primary tumor is being planned; OR participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon with resectable liver metastases for which liver resection is being planned; OR participants may have a colon biopsy that is suspicious for adenocarcinoma if clinical and/or endoscopic findings strongly support the presence of malignancy, and if surgical resection is being planned; NOTE: in the unlikely event that the final pathology of the surgical resection specimen is consistent with high-grade adenoma or dysplasia, the patient will not be considered ineligible and collected research samples will still be utilized
