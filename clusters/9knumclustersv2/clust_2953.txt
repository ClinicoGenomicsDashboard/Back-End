Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma or with relapsed primary CNS lymphoma will be eligible for cyclophosphamide (Cy)/TBI arm; patients with active CNS disease are eligible if they have completed a standard treatment for CNS lymphoma and have no evidence of progressive CNS disease at the time of enrollment
