Patients must have progressed (in the opinion of the treating investigator) following the most recent line of therapy
Patients must have progressed radiographically following first line platinum-based chemotherapy, no additional lines of therapy are permitted\r\n* NOTE: Prior adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage disease does not count as one line of therapy if  months or greater elapsed between completion of adjuvant therapy and initiation of first-line systemic therapy; if less than  months elapsed, adjuvant chemotherapy counts as one line of therapy\r\n* Exception for targeted therapy sub-study (Arm T): At least one line of prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy is required, but there is no limit on number of prior treatments

 prior line of systemic therapy for multiple myeloma, where a line of therapy for myeloma is defined as  or more planned cycles of single agent or combination therapy, as well as a planned series of treatment regimens administered in a sequential manner (e.g. lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy for  cycles followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and then lenalidomide maintenance therapy would be considered  line of prior therapy); a new line of therapy begins when a planned therapy is modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of disease progression, disease relapse or treatment-related toxicity (e.g. a patient is progressing in the face of lenalidomide maintenance therapy and has bortezomib and dexamethasone added into their regimen); a new line of therapy also begins when a planned treatment-free interval is interrupted by the need to start treatment due to disease relapse/progression (e.g. a patient with relapsed myeloma achieves a partial response after a planned  cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone, enjoys an -month period off therapy but then experiences disease progression requiring re-initiation of therapy)
No more than one prior line of chemotherapy for GCT (other than the  cycle of salvage chemotherapy)\r\n* Definition of one line of chemotherapy: One line of therapy can in some cases consist of  different cisplatin-based treatment combinations, provided there is no disease progression between these two regimens; for example, a patient could have received  cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) followed by  cycles of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide (VIP) if the switch from BEP to VIP was made due to pulmonary toxicity rather than disease progression; this would be considered  line of prior therapy; in addition, if a patient received  cycles of BEP and then underwent post-chemotherapy resection of residual tumor with findings of residual viable non-teratomatous GCT, and subsequently received  additional cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (etoposide, cisplatin [EP] or an alternate regimen such as VIP) in the absence of disease progression, this would also be considered  regimen; however, if any change in therapy is prompted by tumor progression including rising tumor markers, this is considered to represent  lines of prior treatment\r\n* Prior treatment with carboplatin as adjuvant therapy is allowed, provided patients meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., the patient has also received - cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy)\r\n* Prior treatment with - cycles of BEP or EP as adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage GCT is allowed, provided the patient also received - cycles of BEP or EP again at relapse; patients treated with - cycles of VIP at relapse following - cycles of BEP/EP are not eligible as this would be considered more than  line of prior therapy

Patient has received more than one line of chemotherapy for advanced disease.
Patients must have completed at least  prior line of systemic therapy; patients who have declined first line therapy or for whom first-line therapy would be clinically inappropriate, will be considered eligible for the trial
Patient has received any second line therapy to treat aGVHD prior to screening.
second-line or greater salvage systemic therapy, or
Available Viralym-C T cell line
Patients must have already received or refused st-line treatment
The cycles of chemotherapy must be consecutive (i.e. one followed by the other) but do not have to be the first and second cycle of a line of treatment.
Completed  to  weeks of first- or second-line treatment with trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy
Stable brain metastasis (defined as asymptomatic and off steroids ? months) are permitted in subjects entering LPT on second-line treatment (completed - weeks of second-line treatment with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy)
Patients must have received one prior approved therapy for metastatic disease and have not curable options, with the exception of HER+ breast or gastric patients for whom this can be the first line of treatment (no prior therapy)
Cancer progression after treatment with the following: surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide as first line treatment with no other therapy prior to tumor recurrence.
nd line, rd line or greater
Patients with Hodgkins lymphoma with one or more of the following: \r\n* Less than complete response to first-line chemotherapy\r\n* Relapse within  months of completion of first-line chemotherapy\r\n* Relapse within a prior irradiation field\r\n* Less than complete metabolic response to second-line chemotherapy\r\n* Second relapse or beyond\r\n* Extranodal disease at the time of relapse\r\n* Presence of B symptoms at the time of persistent disease upon completion of first-line chemotherapy, relapse or progressive disease\r\n* Bulky disease (defined as any lesion greater than  cm) at the time of persistent disease upon completion of first-line chemotherapy, relapse or progressive disease
No primary induction failure, defined as failure to achieve CR with first-line chemotherapy or chemoradiation, disease progression during first-line chemotherapy or chemoradiation, or progression or biopsy-proven disease persistence within  weeks of first-line therapy completion
Patients eligible for second-line therapy after failing first-line therapy with the regimen FOLFIRINOX.
Failure of rituximab for first-line treatment of PTLD. Note: Subjects with CD negative disease are eligible to enroll without prior anti-CD therapy after failure of first-line treatment (reduction of immunosuppression is not considered first-line therapy) and discussion with the sponsor's medical monitor.
HCC patients only:\r\n* First line (i.e., no prior systemic therapy) or second-line (with prior first-line sorafenib therapy only) advanced HCC \r\n* Child Pugh class A or B liver disease \r\n* Prior chemoembolization, radioembolization, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or other local ablative therapies are permissible if >=  weeks from procedure with evidence of progression or new metastatic disease, if applicable (Phase I)
Prior treatment with at least one platinum-based line of treatment (for stage IIIb/IV) and no more than one additional line of chemotherapy treatment; the last dose of chemotherapy must have been administered >/=  days prior to Day 
Any progression during treatment if the len/dex combination was the subject's most recent line of therapy
Must have had one prior line of systemic therapy for AL; Note: patients who do not achieve at least a PR to frontline therapy in  months may be eligible after discussion with study chair
Patients must have received first line standard systemic therapy for their metastases (if applicable)
First-line cytotoxic chemotherapy started within four-weeks of enrollment (patients can have reviewed prior = adjuvant therapy if completed >=  months prior to start of first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease)
Planning to receive first-line chemotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
Patients receiving rd-line palliative chemotherapy
Patients with cGvHD who have been exposed to one or more line of therapy, are eligible, providing they are refractory to, or dependent on, glucocorticoids (usually prednisone [PDN]); (in fact, it is anticipated that the majority of patients will be resistant to multiple lines of therapy); in the case in which the glucocorticoid dose-regimens cannot be confirmed accurately the use of one additional line of therapy will substitute
There must be no prior second-line or third line therapies for aGVHD (with exception of mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) or second or third line therapies for cGVHD (other than extracorporeal photopheresis, rituximab or MMF); second and third line therapies for aGVHD and cGVHD are as defined by the British Committee on Standards in Hematology and reproduced in the GVHD Policy of the Blood and Marrow Transplant program (version -); all prior therapies other than corticosteroids, tacrolimus, sirolimus or cyclosporine must be completed and discontinued; patients with breakpoint cluster region (bcr)-ABL proto-oncogene  (abl) associated malignancies may be on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as malignant disease therapy or prophylaxis
Newly diagnoses or needing a new line of therapy and have not yet made a treatment decision
With income at or below % of the poverty line
Presence of an external central line
Have a central line in place prior to IV study therapy
Patients who are unable to have placement of intravenous line access
Well differentiated, low, intermediate, or high-grade, pancreatic NET with documented disease progression within  months prior to start of study treatment and evidence of radiographic disease progression based on scans performed not more than  months apart. Patients may have received  or more prior lines of anticancer therapy, such as somatostatin analogues, targeted agents, or liverdirected intra-arterial therapy, and up to  prior line of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, but are NOT eligible if they have received more than  prior line of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or if they have received prior peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)
Subjects with a central venous line
Patient is about to start a new line of ET for their metastatic disease
