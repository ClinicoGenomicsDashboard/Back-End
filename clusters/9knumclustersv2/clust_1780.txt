Solitary bone or solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia.
Previously treated myeloma, currently with extramedullary disease (defined as plasmacytoma outside bone marrow that is not contiguous with a bone lesion) with at least one lesion that has a single diameter of >=  cm or plasma cell leukemia (defined as circulating plasma cells exceeding % of peripheral blood leukocytes or . X ^/L or  cells/ events by flow cytometry)
Concurrent symptomatic amyloidosis or plasma cell leukemia
Patients with non-secretory multiple myeloma, active plasma cell leukemia, defined as either having % of peripheral white blood cells comprised of CD+ plasma cells, or an absolute plasma cell count of  x ^/L, known amyloidosis, or known POEMS syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes)
PRIOR TO LYMPHODEPLETION: Patients on strong inhibitors of CYPA (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) as these may increase plasma concentrations of bendamustine, and decrease plasma concentrations of its metabolites
Active plasma cell leukemia (defined as either % of peripheral white blood cells comprised of plasma/CD+ cells or an absolute plasma cell count of  x ^/L)
Multiple myeloma specific:\r\n* Active or prior plasma cell leukemia (defined as either % of peripheral white blood cell [WBC] comprised of plasma/cluster of differentiation [CD]+ cells or an absolute count of  x ^/L)\r\n* Solitary bone or solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma as the only evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia
Evidence of end-organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder, specifically:
The subject must have a documented CMV infection in whole blood or plasma, with a screening value of greater than or equal to (>=)  international units per milliliter (IU/mL) in whole blood or >=  IU/mL in plasma in  consecutive assessments, separated by at least  day, as determined by local or central speciality laboratory quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or comparable quantitative CMV DNA results. Both samples should be taken within  days prior to randomization with second sample obtained within  days prior to randomization. The same laboratory and same sample type (whole blood or plasma) must be used for these assessments.
