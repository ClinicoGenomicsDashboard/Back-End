Uveal melanoma is excluded
Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or unresectable uveal melanoma or non-uveal melanoma harboring a GNAQ or GNA mutation; Note: For subjects with a diagnosis of uveal melanoma, documentation of mutation status for uveal melanoma will not be required prospectively given the high rate of GNAQ/ mutations (> %) in this population
Melanoma (excluding uveal melanoma);
Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV uveal melanoma
Patients with uveal melanoma will not be eligible as these tumors show low expression of GD
History of uveal melanoma
Patients with melanoma arising from uveal/ocular primary sites.
Patients with carcinomatosis meningitis or a history of ocular/uveal melanoma are excluded
Must have a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic melanoma (cutaneous, acral-lentiginous, uveal and mucosal in origin), based on histological analysis of metastatic tissue and/or cancer cells, archival tissue permitted
Histologic diagnosis of metastatic uveal melanoma.
Diagnosis of uveal melanoma with histological or cytological confirmed metastatic disease. Disease must be treatment naive or have progressed (radiologically or clinically) on most recent therapy.
CAPMATINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Uveal melanoma
CERITINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Uveal melanoma
REGORAFENIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Uveal melanoma
ENTRECTINIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Uveal melanoma
Histologically-confirmed primary uveal melanoma
Metastatic uveal melanoma
Untreated primary uveal melanoma except in cases where metastatic disease is diagnosed at the time of primary disease
Metastatic uveal melanoma patients with bone-only disease
Patients must have metastatic melanoma, uveal melanoma or stage III in-transit or regional nodal disease (Turnstile I)
Measurable metastatic uveal melanoma
Patients with uveal/ocular melanoma are excluded
Mucosal melanoma and uveal melanoma are not allowed
Histologically or cytologically confirmed uveal melanoma that is metastatic or unresectable; if histologic or cytologic confirmation of the primary is not available, confirmation of the primary diagnosis of uveal melanoma by the treating investigator can be clinically obtained, as per standard practice for uveal melanoma; pathologic confirmation of diagnosis will be performed at the participating site
History of uveal melanoma
Subjects must not have primary uveal or mucosal melanoma, history or evidence of melanoma associated with immunodeficiency states or history of other malignancy within the past  years.
For melanoma: Uveal melanoma or LDH >. x ULN
Histologic or cytologic documentation of metastatic or Stage IIIc unresectable melanoma, with BRAFV mutation as assessed by BRAFV Mutation Test. Origin of the primary tumor may be of skin, mucosal, or acral locations but not of uveal origin. Participants having an unknown primary tumor may be eligible if uveal melanoma can be ruled out
Uveal or ocular melanoma
Ocular or uveal melanoma
Uveal or ocular MEL
Primary uveal or mucosal melanoma
The patient has uveal melanoma.
Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM)
Eligibility for pheresis: (Turnstile ) Histopathologic documentation of melanoma concurrent with the diagnosis of metastatic disease. A diagnosis of uveal melanoma can be made clinically without primary tissue evaluation, based on history and records. A prior history of brachytherapy to the eye is sufficient clinical support for a diagnosis of uveal melanoma.
Patient has uveal melanoma
Histologic confirmation of advanced (metastatic or unresectable) uveal melanoma; if uveal melanoma has been diagnosed clinically and/or by gene expression profiling, patients may be included following discussion with the principal investigator
Metastatic histologically or cytologically confirmed uveal melanoma with pathologic confirmation at a participating center that is judged to be progressive in the opinion of the treating physician; for the dose escalation portion of the trial only, patients with non-uveal melanoma harboring a GNAQ or GNA mutation will also be eligible
Uveal and mucosal melanoma
Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma
Uveal or mucosal melanoma
Patients must have metastatic histologically or cytologically confirmed uveal melanoma; (if histologic or cytologic confirmation of the primary is not available, confirmation of the primary diagnosis of uveal melanoma by the treating investigator can be clinically obtained, as per standard practice for uveal melanoma); pathologic confirmation of diagnosis will be performed at Columbia University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) or Vanderbilt University Medical Center
Uveal melanoma with biopsy proven metastatic disease
Primary diagnosis of uveal melanoma at least  mm in largest basal diameter as clinically determined by the treating investigator; cytologic determination of diagnosis is not required; size is based on clinical assessment (e.g. by ultrasound or direct ophthalmoscopy) prior to enucleation or radiation therapy
Definitive therapy of the primary uveal melanoma must have been performed within  days of initiating protocol therapy
High-risk (class ) uveal melanoma as determined by gene expression profiling (GEP)
Patients with histologically confirmed viral related hepatocellular, SCLC, non-cutaneous/ non-uveal melanoma, ovarian, TNBC, Sarcoma, Bladder and RCC.
Melanoma of uveal origin
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or locally recurrent uveal melanoma; because histologic or cytologic confirmation of primary uveal melanoma is not always possible, confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of uveal melanoma by the treating investigator is allowed; clinical diagnosis of uveal melanoma is often made by an ophthalmologist, not by tissue diagnosis; if an ophthalmologist diagnosed and treated a patient for uveal melanoma in the past, it is sufficient for a clinical diagnosis
All melanomas, except ocular/uveal melanoma, regardless of primary site of disease will be allowed; mucosal melanomas are eligible.
Patients with carcinomatosis meningitis or a history of ocular/uveal melanoma are excluded.
Clinical diagnosis of primary uveal melanoma involving the posterior uveal tract in the study eye
Planned enucleation or brachytherapy of the study eye due to uveal melanoma
Uveal melanoma in the study eye originating in the anterior uveal tract (iris)
Patients must have metastatic histologically or cytologically confirmed uveal melanoma; if histologic or cytologic confirmation of the primary is not available, confirmation of the primary diagnosis of uveal melanoma by the treating investigator can be clinically obtained, as per standard practice for uveal melanoma; pathologic confirmation of metastatic disease will be performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) or at a participating site
Uveal Melanoma with liver metastasis
Part A & B (RCC, NSCLC, HCC, and uveal melanoma): Have measurable disease as defined by RECIST v..
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic uveal melanoma
