Absence of decompensated congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled arrhythmia and left ventricular ejection fraction > %; for children not able to cooperate with multigated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiography, such should be clearly stated in the physicians documentation
Left ventricular ejection fraction ? %, assessed within  months prior to study day , e.g. by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality and no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure

Left ventricular systolic dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction below institutional normal by echocardiography or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA); or current or past clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure; history of ejection fraction decreased to below institutional normal or decrease of greater than % attributable to past trastuzumab or pertuzumab therapy
Baseline (<  month before treatment) cardiac left ventricular function with resting ejection fraction of less than % measured by multigated blood pool imaging of the heart (multi gated acquisition scan [MUGA] scan) or echocardiogram

Patients must not have symptomatic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, or uncontrolled arrhythmias; either an echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan with an ejection fraction >= % must be obtained within  days prior to registration, or within  days prior to registration if the patient has received anthracycline in the  day window; (either method for measuring cardiac function is acceptable; however, the same scan must be used throughout treatment and follow-up to monitor the patient for cardiac toxicity); if the patient has symptoms suggestive of ischemia or congestive heart failure after that cardiac evaluation was done, a repeat study must be obtained prior to registration
Patients must not have symptomatic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, or uncontrolled arrhythmias; either an echocardiogram or MUGA scan with an ejection fraction >= % must be obtained within  days prior to registration; (the same scan that was used during induction registration must be used for consolidation registration); the ejection fraction must not have dropped >= % from the baseline ejection fraction; if patient has had symptoms suggestive of ischemia or congestive heart failure after that cardiac evaluation was done, a repeat study must be obtained prior to registration
Left ventricular ejection fraction >= %, assessed within  months prior to study day , e.g. by multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality and no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure; if the patient had anthracycline-based therapy since the most recent cardiac assessment, cardiac evaluation should be repeated if there is clinical or radiographic suspicion of cardiac dysfunction, or if the previous cardiac assessment was abnormal
