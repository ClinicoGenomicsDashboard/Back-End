Stage IV disease diagnosed within  weeks of randomization
Stage IV disease (measurable disease NOT required)
Stage II, III, or IV disease

Patient must have measurable stage IV disease (includes Ma, Mb stages or recurrent disease) (according to the th edition of the TNM classification system); however, patients with TNX disease (stage III B) with nodule(s) in ipsilateral lung lobe are not eligible, because such patients were not included in historical controls
Stage IV disease at the start of first-line chemotherapy
