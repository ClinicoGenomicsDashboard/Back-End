Patients requiring warfarin are not eligible
Any patients on warfarin therapy
Patients being treated with Warfarin.
Requires continued use of warfarin for anticoagulation and cannot stop warfarin to be safely switched to another anticoagulant
Patients taking warfarin; if anticoagulation is required, the patient must be on a stable dose of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anticoagulant other than warfarin (e.g. enoxaparin, dalteparin, fondaparinux, apixaban, rivaroxaban) for at least  days
Patients must not be receiving systemic anticoagulation with warfarin; patients must be off warfarin for  days prior to enrollment; patients who require anticoagulation with an agent other than warfarin will not be excluded, but must be reviewed by the principal investigator prior to enrollment
Currently using warfarin.
The patient is currently on warfarin or heparin therapy
Currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin;
Participants receiving oral warfarin are not eligible for this study (unless warfarin is discontinued at least  days prior to commencement of treatment and for the duration of the study, or oral warfarin is converted to LMWH, where local clinical opinion considers this an acceptable option).
International normalization ratio (INR) < . times ULN, or if on warfarin, can safely transition off for biopsy
International normalization ratio (INR) < . times ULN, or if on warfarin, can safely transition off for biopsy
Patients on warfarin
Anticoagulation is permitted but patients may not be on warfarin
They must not require concomitant treatment with warfarin.
International normalized ratio (INR) < ., except for subjects receiving warfarin therapy; for subjects who are receiving warfarin for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis, INR values should be carefully monitored while patients are on study
Anticoagulation with warfarin
Requirement for anticoagulation with warfarin
Currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin;
Requires continued use of warfarin for anticoagulation and cannot stop warfarin or be safely switched to another anticoagulant
Individuals who require therapy with warfarin
Receiving warfarin therapy and cannot tolerate drug substitution
Patients receiving chronic or acute warfarin treatment are not excluded, but should be monitored very closely or considered for switch to other therapies. PA- is both highly protein bound and a competitive inhibitor of CYPC at higher concentrations and thus may potentiate the action of warfarin in patients
Patients receiving warfarin anticoagulation, who cannot be transitioned to other agents such as enoxaparin or dabigatran, and for whom anticoagulants cannot be held for up to  hours
Anticoagulation with warfarin
Current therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin (or coumarin derivatives)
Requirement for chronic anticoagulation with warfarin or with direct oral anticoagulants at the time of screening.
Patients must not be receiving active systemic anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin; patients must be off warfarin therapy for at least  days prior to enrollment
Patients taking warfarin or platelet inhibitors
Treatment with warfarin or other vitamin K antagonist; patients with using warfarin who switch to another form of anticoagulation will be eligible
Patients who require warfarin for anticoagulation (other anticoagulants are allowed)
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< , international normalized ratio (INR) =< . x institutional ULN unless on warfarin therapy (investigator would need to determine if safe for participant to stop warfarin prior to biopsy and warfarin therapy)
Patients on warfarin for any reason
Receiving warfarin treatment
Patients must not be on phenytoin, warfarin or methadone
International normalized ratio (INR) =< . institutional ULN unless on warfarin therapy (investigator would need to determine if safe for participant to stop warfarin prior to biopsy)
Current therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin (or coumarin derivatives)
Current treatment with warfarin
Receiving warfarin
Warfarin is not permitted
Therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin, heparins, or heparinoids
Patients receiving warfarin anticoagulation, who cannot be transferred to other agents such as enoxaparin or dabigatran, and for whom anticoagulants cannot be held for up to  hours will be excluded
Any condition requiring warfarin or thrombolytic anticoagulants
PT INR > . unless the patient is on full-dose warfarin
Coagulopathies - patients requiring full dose anticoagulation with warfarin are excluded, however, patients stable and on other anticoagulants can be included.
Able to take anticoagulation, warfarin or equivalent agent, as detailed in the treatment plan
Receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g. warfarin, heparin) other than aspirin
PT INR > . unless the patient is on full-dose warfarin
Patients on warfarin or plavix
Patients receiving warfarin anticoagulation, who cannot be transferred to other agents such as enoxaparin or dabigatran, and for whom anticoagulants cannot be held for up to  hours will be excluded
International normalized ratio (INR) =< . ULN unless on warfarin therapy (investigator would need to determine if safe for participant to stop warfarin prior to surgery and warfarin therapy)
Warfarin: In-range INR (usually between  and ) within  days prior to registration
Receiving warfarin at registration
Anticoagulation with warfarin
Are being treated with warfarin anticoagulation therapy
Receiving Warfarin
Are on an anticoagulant (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban) regimen
Warfarin is not permitted
Any condition requiring warfarin or thrombolytic anticoagulants
