TURNSTILE I - SCREENING:
TURNSTILE II - TREATMENT:
Patients must sign the treatment consent document before Turnstile II screening procedures; before the treatment starts and at each visit, the patient will be asked to complete two quality of life questionnaires; It should take about  minutes to complete the questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General [FACT-G], FACT-Melanoma); patients must fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligible for Turnstile II of the study
TURNSTILE I - SCREENING
TURNSTILE II - TREATMENT
Patients must have metastatic melanoma or stage III in-transit, subcutaneous, or regional nodal disease (Turnstile I)
Patients must have a lesion amenable to resection for the generation of TIL (Turnstile I)
Patients receiving cytotoxic agents will be evaluated by the PI or his designee for eligibility suitability (Turnstile I)
Patients must have adequate TIL available (Turnstile II); pre-rapid expansion procedure (Pre-REP) TIL generated in the similar clinical trial - may also be utilized for Turnstile II
Patients must have at least one biopsiable measurable metastatic melanoma, lesion > or = to  cm (Turnstile II)
Patients may have brain lesions =<  cm each; the PI or designee will approve the treatment (Turnstile II)
Clinical performance status of ECOG - within  days of signing informed consent (Turnstile II)
Serum creatinine less than or equal to . mg/dl (Turnstile II)
MRI/CT/PET of the brain within  days of lymphodepletion (Turnstile II)
Patients who are pregnant or nursing (Turnstile I)
Presence of a significant psychiatric disease, which in the opinion of the principal investigator or his designee, would prevent adequate informed consent (Turnstile I)
Women who are pregnant will be excluded (Turnstile II)
Presence of a significant psychiatric disease, which in the opinion of the principal investigator or his designee, would prevent adequate informed consent or render immunotherapy unsafe or contraindicated (Turnstile II)
