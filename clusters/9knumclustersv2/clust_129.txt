Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patients participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator; this includes known active tuberculosis; grade  active infection; history of allogeneic bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant; known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); known active hepatitis B (eg, hepatitis [Hep] B deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] positive in prior  months) or known active hepatitis C (eg, hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected in prior  months)
Virus or active hepatitis B virus infection; patients who are hepatitis B core antibody (Hep B cAb) positive may be eligible as long as there is no evidence of active infection with negative hepatitis B (Hep B) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); in this case, Hep B PCR must be monitored monthly
Known HIV, or active hep B or hep C infection (detected positive by PCR).
Serologic or clinical evidence of current active hepatitis B or C infection, defined as elevated levels of hepatitis (Hep) B antigen or Hep C antibody (unless active infection is ruled out by nucleic acid tests)
Positive screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis (Hep) B, Hep C, active tuberculosis or recent (<  week ago) clinically significant infection or evidence of active HIV, Hep B, or Hep C. (Note: If positive results are not indicative of true active or chronic infection, the patient can be treated.)
Positive screening tests for HIV, Hep B, and Hep C. If positive results are not indicative of true active or chronic infection, the patient can be treated.
Positive screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis (Hep) B, and Hep C; if positive results are not indicative of true active or chronic infection, the patient can be treated
Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C (no additional laboratory tests for HIV, hepatitis [Hep] B, or Hep C are required for screening)
Patients must not have a known history of active hepatitis B infection (defined as presence of hepatitis B surface antigen [Hep B sAg] and/ or Hep B deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]), active hepatitis C infection (defined as presence of hepatitis C [Hep C] ribonucleic acid [RNA]) and/or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive
CLINICAL/LABORATORY CRITERIA: Patients must not have a known history of active hepatitis B or C infection (defined as presence of hepatitis [Hep] B surface antigen [sAg] and/or Hep B deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and/or Hep C ribonucleic acid [RNA]); patients must not have a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity
Subject has active hepatitis B or C. Subject with hepatitis in medical history may be eligible if infection considered cleared, ie core Ab+, surface Ab+, surface Ag- for hep B and Ab+/DNA- for hep C.
History of active or chronic hepatitis (e.g. Hep B or C)
No positive Hep C serology or active Hep B infection
Positive screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (Hep B), and hepatitis C virus (Hep C). If positive results are not indicative of true active or chronic infection, the patient can be treated.
Positive screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (hep B), and hepatitis C (hep C) (referencing blood draw at leukapheresis screening); if positive results are not indicative of true active or chronic infection, the patient can be treated
Hep B and Hep C
Hepatitis (Hep) B & C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, due to concerns in the ability to stimulate an effective immune response (determined by historical medical data)
known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus or chronic active Hep B or C.
