Extensive active brain disease including symptomatic brain metastases or presence of leptomeningeal disease
Patients with symptomatic brain metastases who have not completed radiation therapy and/or are receiving systemic steroid therapy; patients with leptomeningeal disease will be excluded
The participant has documented brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.
Confirmed brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases
Patients must not have symptomatic uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases.
Active brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases; treated, asymptomatic metastases are permitted provided the patient has been off steroids for at least  month prior to day  of study drug
Subject has known or suspected primary brain or leptomeningeal metastases
Subject has known symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement as assessed by CT scan or MRI. Subjects with stable asymptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if they have not required new treatments for this disease in a  day period before the first dose of study drug, and anticonvulsants and steroids have not been administered for a period of  weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
Brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease

Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases
A history of or evidence of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.
Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases
Patients with brain or central nervous system metastases, including leptomeningeal disease

Brain or leptomeningeal metastases that are symptomatic and/or requiring treatment
Patients with brain metastases (treated or untreated) leptomeningeal disease, uncontrolled seizure disorder, or active neurologic disease
Uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement; patients with brain metastases are permitted if they have received appropriate therapy and demonstrated control of the brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease following therapy; patients with known brain metastases will require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain to demonstrate disease control prior to enrollment (lack of symptom progression for two weeks off therapeutic doses of steroids, excluding chronic steroids used for control of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD])
