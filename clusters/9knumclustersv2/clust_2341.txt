Total bilirubin must be < . x the upper limit of normal, unless the elevation of bilirubin is thought to be secondary to Gilberts syndrome or combined antiretroviral therapy (cART); if, however, the elevated bilirubin is felt to be secondary to antiretroviral therapy, the total bilirubin must be =< . mg/dL, provided that the direct bilirubin is normal and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =<  x the upper limit of normal; also, if the elevated bilirubin is thought to be secondary to cHL the same criteria for hyperbilirubinemia should be applied; however  prior cycle of cyclophosphamide is permitted in attempt to make the participant eligible; patients should not be excluded from study participation unless dosing cannot be safely established
Total bilirubin =< . x institutional upper limit of normal, unless related to leukemic infiltration or hemolysis
Total bilirubin =< upper limit of normal (ULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to Gilberts syndrome
Bilirubin =< . x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilberts syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within  days prior to registration)
Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits unless thought due to hemolysis or to Gilberts syndrome
Direct bilirubin or ALT >  x upper limit of normal, unless these abnormalities are thought to be related to Gilberts disease or leukemic infiltration of hepatic parenchyma
Bilirubin =<  times institutional upper limit of normal unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilberts syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within  days prior to study day )
Bilirubin =<  . x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to Gilberts syndrome, hemolysis, or hepatic infiltration by the hematologic malignancy
Alkaline phosphatase =< . x ULN, unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by the hematologic malignancy
PART : Total serum bilirubin must be <  mg/dL unless the elevation is thought to be due to Gilberts disease or hemolysis
Bilirubin ? . x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilberts syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within  days prior to study day )
Total serum bilirubin must be < mg/dL unless the elevation is thought to be due to Gilberts disease or hemolysis
Patients must have a total bilirubin =< . x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) within  days prior to registration, unless the elevation is due primarily to elevated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia secondary to Gilberts syndrome or hemolysis and not to liver dysfunction
Total bilirubin =< . x IULN within  days prior to registration, unless the elevation is due primarily to elevated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia secondary to Gilberts syndrome or hemolysis and not to liver dysfunction
Bilirubin =< . x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilberts syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within  days prior to study day )
Liver function abnormalities as indicated by ongoing hepatic enzyme elevation (e.g. AST, ALT, GGT) >  x the ULN. Elevation related to direct tumor infiltration is allowed.
Direct bilirubin =< . upper limit of normal (ULN) age unless elevation thought to be due or hepatic infiltration by the hematologic malignancy
Total serum bilirubin must be <  mg/dL unless the elevation is thought to be due to Gilbert's disease or hemolysis
LVEF by ECHO or MUGA within institutional normal limits unless thought to be disease related; DLCO >= % with no symptomatic pulmonary disease unless thought to be disease related
Total bilirubin =< . x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless elevation is deemed due to leukemia infiltration; in these patients, dose modification may be required based on standard guidelines
Serum bilirubin =< . x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless elevation is considered to be secondary to Gilberts syndrome, hemolysis, or hepatic infiltration by AML
Bilirubin greater than . mg/dl (> mol/L) unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilbert syndrome, or hemolysis.
Bilirubin =<  x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilberts syndrome, or hemolysis (assessed within  days prior to study day )
