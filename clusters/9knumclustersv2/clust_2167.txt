Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and other histologies such as diffuse large B cell NHL: not eligible for autologous HCT, not eligible for high-dose allogeneic HCT, or after failed autologous HCT
Aggressive nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and other histologies such as diffuse large B cell NHL not eligible for autologous HCT, not eligible for high-dose allogeneic HCT, or after failed autologous HCT
Patients with:\r\n* CLL who are beyond first remission and who have failed combination chemoimmunotherapy with regimens containing a purine analogue and anti-CD antibody or who were not eligible for such therapy; patients with CLL for whom ibrutinib is now standard first line therapy, must have progressed on ibrutinib; patients with fludarabine refractory disease are eligible; patients may be treated following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT); for the concurrent ibrutinib cohort, patients must agree to continue on or be restarted on ibrutinib and must not have had prior intolerance to ibrutinib that would prevent this; patients managed with prior dose reductions for toxicity will continue at the reduced dose for the remainder of this study\r\n* Indolent NHL or mantle cell NHL who are beyond first remission and previously treated with chemoimmunotherapy or who were not eligible for such therapy; patients who have relapsed following autologous or allogeneic HCT are eligible\r\n* Aggressive NHL such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have relapsed or have residual disease following treatment with curative intent; patients should have relapsed following, or not be eligible for high-dose therapy and autologous HCT; patients with chemotherapy refractory disease or marrow involvement or comorbidities precluding successful autologous HCT are eligible; patients may be treated following allogeneic HCT\r\n* Patients with CD expressing, relapsed or refractory ALL\r\n* Patients with one of the above diagnoses whose disease state does not qualify but who have prognostic indicators that suggest a high risk of progression of disease may be screened and undergo leukapheresis; enrollment for T cell therapy would require meeting the full disease state eligibility

Hodgkin lymphoma  must have received and a) failed frontline therapy, b) not be eligible for autologous HCT, or c) or be part of a tandem auto-allo approach for high risk patients
Patients eligible for a curative autologous HCT
Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and other histologies such as diffuse large B-cell NHL  not eligible for autologous HCT, not eligible for high-dose allogeneic HCT, or after failed autologous HCT
Patients eligible for and willing to receive potentially curative high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT
