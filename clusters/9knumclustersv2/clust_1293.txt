Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus)
Previous hypersensitivity to rapamycin or rapamycin derivatives
History of allergic reactions, intolerance or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to TRC and/or everolimus or other rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus)
Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus)
Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus)
Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus)
TREATMENT: Patients who have received prior everolimus or other mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors or those with known intolerance or hypersensitivity to other rapamycin analogs (e.g., sirolimus, temsirolimus) would not be eligible to receive everolimus on study; if these patients have mutations of interest in pathways other than the phosphatidylinositol-,-bisphosphate -kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (pIK) pathway, they will be eligible to receive agents based on that mutation
