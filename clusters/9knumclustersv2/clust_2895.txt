Presence of >= % circulating leukemic blasts (in the peripheral blood) detected by standard pathology
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =<  x the institutional ULN; elevation secondary to leukemic involvement is not an exclusion criterion; leukemic involvement will be determined by the presence of progressive relapsed defined by escalating bone marrow or peripheral blood leukemia blasts within the previous month and the absence of initiation of known hepatotoxic medication (e.g. azoles)
