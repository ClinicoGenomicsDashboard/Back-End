Agree to undergo a biopsy of at least one metastatic site or primary prostate for determination of the RB status; adequate archival metastatic tissue can be used if available in lieu of a biopsy if done when patient had CRPC (within  months of treatment start)
Patients enrolled in Part  must have at least  (preferably ) slides of archival tumor tissue from a prior surgery demonstrating GBM; patients enrolled in Part  will not be required to have archival tissue
All patients must agree to provide an archival tissue block or paraffin sample from archival tissue block (approximately  sections) for use in pharmacodynamic correlative studies; however, patients are not considered ineligible if archival tumor is not available
Availability of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tumor specimens, when available, and willingness of the subject to undergo mandatory fresh tumor biopsy prior to treatment initiation unless determined medically unsafe or not feasible; given that fresh tumor tissue is required for correlative assessments, a prior biopsy cannot take the place of the pre-treatment mandatory biopsy\r\n* The archival specimen, when available, must contain adequate viable tumor tissue\r\n* The specimen may consist of a tissue block (preferred and should contain the highest grade of tumor) or at least  unstained serial sections; fine-needle aspiration, brushings, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy are not acceptable\r\n* A mandatory biopsy at the time of radiographic progression will be requested from patients who have an initial response to treatment and then subsequently progress as determined by RECIST version .
Archival tumor tissue from biopsy or resection will be required for all patients; archival tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor contents; fine needle aspiration, brushing, and cytologic cell pellets are not acceptable
Willingness to undergo a tumor biopsy prior to starting treatment (or if biopsy is not feasible, provide archival tissue).
Archival tumor specimen according to protocol-defined criteria.
Patients without either fresh or archival tumor tissue accessible.
Consent to provide archival tissue
Patients with archival tumor tissue suitable for measurement of proteasome activity and biomarker status must give permission to access and test the tissue. Patients without archival tumor tissue are eligible for the Dose-Escalation stage, but not the Dose-Expansion stage of the study
Consent for the use of any residual material from biopsy (archival tissue) and serial blood draws will be required for enrollment; patients without adequate tissue for bio-correlates will not be excluded or required to have a repeat biopsy
