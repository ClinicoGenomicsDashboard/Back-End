Patients with history of seizure as an adult including febrile seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization). Also current or prior treatment with anti-epileptic medications for the treatment of seizures. Transient ischemic attack within  months prior to study enrollment will not be permitted.
Patients with a history of seizure disorder, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past  months, cerebral vascular accident, brain metastases, brain arteriovenous malformation
Patients with prior history of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past  months, cerebral vascular accident, brain arteriovenous malformation or the use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold or other conditions predisposing to seizure
Patients with a history of seizures, predisposing factors for seizures, including underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness within previous  months, transient ischemic attack within previous  months, cerebral vascular accident or brain arteriovenous malformation
History of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past  months, cerebral vascular accident, brain metastases, and brain arteriovenous malformations
Patients with a history of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past  months, cerebral vascular accident, brain metastases, brain arteriovenous malformation or the use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold
History of seizure including febrile seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization); also, current or prior treatment with antiepileptic medications for the treatment of seizures or history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within  months prior to randomization
History of seizures (taking/not taking anticonvulsants), arteriovenous malformation in the brain, head trauma with loss of consciousness
history of traumatic brain or head injury with loss of consciousness
History of seizure, including any febrile seizure, loss of consciousness, or transient ischemic attack, or any condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization)
Patients with history of seizure as an adult including febrile seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization); also, current or prior treatment with anti-epileptic medications for the treatment of seizures or history of loss of consciousness; also transient ischemic attack within  months prior to randomization will not be permitted
Patients with predisposing factors for seizure including history of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past  months, cerebral vascular accident, brain metastasis, and brain arteriovenous malformation
History of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past  months, cerebral vascular accident, brain arteriovenous malformation or the use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold (not applicable to patients who have already been treated with enzalutamide in first line before inclusion).
History of significant neurological disease including poorly controlled seizures (i.e., >  seizure per month; anti-epileptic medications are acceptable), stroke, or head injury with loss of consciousness
Significant history of head injury/trauma as defined by loss of consciousness for more than one hour
History of stroke or head injury associated with loss of consciousness within  months of registration
History of brain injury that significantly impacted cognition; as indicated responses on the Ohio State University Traumatic Brain Injury Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID) greater or equal to any of the following:  minutes or more of loss of consciousness (LOC), two or more mild cases within two weeks of each other, or any injury with loss of consciousness before the age of 
History of seizure including febrile seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization); also, current or prior treatment with antiepileptic medications for the treatment of seizures or history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within  months of enrollment
With history of a neurological disorder, neurodegenerative disease, or traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness (>  minutes), as per medical records or patient report
History of seizure, including any febrile seizure, loss of consciousness, or transient ischemic attack, or any condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization)
History of neurological disease known to affect cognition prior to initiating chemotherapy (e.g., stroke, head injury with loss of consciousness of >  minutes, seizure disorder, demyelinating disorder, mental retardation, primary brain tumor, brain metastases, etc.)
History of seizure, including any febrile seizure, loss of consciousness, or transient ischemic attack, or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g. prior stroke, brain arteriovenous malformation, head trauma with loss of consciousness requiring hospitalization)
