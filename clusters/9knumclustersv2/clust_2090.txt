For all patients:\r\n* Radiation dose should range from  cGy to  cGy\r\n* No treatment for this disease following radiation therapy
Prior radiation therapy with  cGY or more of TBI.
Prior radiation therapy with cGy or more of TBI.
Patient must be able to pass radiation evaluation (i.e.: able to receive  cGy)
Any prior therapeutic radiation therapy >  cGy has been delivered
Have received radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide; total radiation dosage can range from  to  cGy administered in daily fractions of  to  cGy over  weeks, or the equivalent in a hypofractionated protocol (for example, cGy in  fractions or cGy in  fractions); patients who are MGMT negative do not need to have received temozolomide
Prior radiation doses equivalent to, or greater than,  cGy to the target lesions at  cGy fractions at any timepoint
No thoracic radiation >  cGy allowed
Significant prior external beam dose-limiting radiation to a critical organ based on review of the prior radiation treatment records by the Radiation Oncology PI; patients who have had prior external beam radiation >  cGy (at  to  cGy per day) to the lung will be ineligible; patients with ANY prior radiation to the heart are ineligible; patients with >  cGy to the kidney will be excluded from the study; Note: patients who have had electron beam therapy are still eligible and will be evaluated on a case by case basis by the Radiation Oncology PI
Patients who had prior radiation to more than % bone marrow containing areas or to any areas exceeding  cGy
Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy >  cGy has been delivered
Significant prior external beam dose-limiting radiation to a critical organ based on review of the prior radiation treatment records by the radiation oncology PI; patients who have had prior external beam radiation >  cGy (at  to  cGy per day) to any portion of the lung will be ineligible; patients with ANY prior radiation to the heart are ineligible; patients with >  cGy to any portion of the kidney will be excluded from the study
Kidney:  cGy
Liver:  cGy
Lungs:  cGy
Previous irradiation that precludes the safe administration of an additional dose of  cGy of TBI
Patients undergoing a total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen (TBI  cGy)
Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy >  cGy has been delivered to the target volume
Prior radiation therapy with  cGy or more of TBI; if  cGy of prior TBI then only  cGy of TBI on this protocol is permitted
Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy >  cGy has been delivered to the target volume
Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy >  cGy has been delivered to the central nervous system
Previous radiation therapy to more than % of bone marrow containing areas, or to any area exceeding  cGy, is an exclusion
Patients who have received >  cGy radiation to the kidneys will be excluded from the study
Patients are not eligible if they have received local radiation which includes any of the following:  centigray (cGy) to more than % of both kidneys (patient must have at least  kidney that has not exceeded the dose/volume of radiation listed) or  cGy to more than % of liver and/or  cGy to more than % of liver; emergency local irradiation is allowed prior to study entry, provided the patient still meets eligibility criteria
Received >=  centigray (cGy) radiation to the heart/chest
>= Ten years post-radiation therapy following an accumulated dose of >=  cGY to the heart/chest
Receiving a dose of radiation therapy greater than or equal to  centigray (cGy) to one third of the oral cavity
Current diagnosis of cancer that supports the use of continuous definitive or adjuvant external-beam RT to the pelvis to a minimum dose of  cGy with the following parameters:\r\n* The pelvis must be encompassed by the planned RT fields; the superior border may not lie inferior to the most inferior aspect of the sacroiliac joints; portions of the rectum may have special blocking, depending upon disease site\r\n* The total prescription dose must lie between - cGy (inclusive); a boost to primary tumor or tumor bed may be planned\r\n* Planned treatment is to be given - times per week on a onetreatment-per-day basis; the daily prescribed dose must lie between - cGy (inclusive) per day
Patient must be cleared pre-transplant by Radiation Oncology to be able to receive  cGy
Patients whose clinical treatment plans include a continuous course of external beam radiotherapy by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and/or image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), given as a cumulative dose of    centigray (cGy) in single daily fractions of  -  cGy, combined with a concurrent course of weekly or tri-weekly cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy
