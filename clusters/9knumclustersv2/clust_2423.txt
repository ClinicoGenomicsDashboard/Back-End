d. Glioblastoma -Enrollment Completed Have histologically confirmed World Health Organization Grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma).
Histologic documentation: newly diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV intracranial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma; GBM with oligodendroglial features are NOT PERMITTED in this study if they are pq codeleted; sites submitting GBM with oligodendroglial features will be asked to provide results of p/q codeletion status
Confirmation by central pathology review of WHO grade IV glioblastoma or gliosarcoma
Newly diagnosed histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme (World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV); patients with secondary glioblastoma, in particular those who are IDH or IDH mutant, will not be excluded
