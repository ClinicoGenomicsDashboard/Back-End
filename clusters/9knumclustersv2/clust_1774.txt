Minimum PSA:\r\n* If no prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for biochemical relapse:\r\n** . ng/mL if prior radical prostatectomy with or without adjuvant/salvage radiation therapy, confirmed by repeat measurement at least  weeks later, or\r\n** Nadir +  ng/mL if prior RT alone without prior radical prostatectomy, confirmed by repeat measurement at least  weeks later\r\n* If prior ADT for biochemical relapse:\r\n** . ng/mL or >  ng/mL above nadir on prior cycle of ADT, whichever is higher, confirmed by repeat measurement at least  weeks later
