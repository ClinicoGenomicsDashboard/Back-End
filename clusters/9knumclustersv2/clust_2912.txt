Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated in this trial within the last  years (with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of skin, bladder, cervix, colon/rectum, breast, or prostate) unless a complete remission without further recurrence was achieved at least  years prior to study entry and the subject was deemed to have been cured with no additional therapy required or anticipated to be required.
Patients with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless definitive therapy has been completed at least  year prior to study entry and the patient is now without evidence of disease from that malignancy and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
Subjects with concomitant second malignancies (except adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of the breast, treated superficial bladder cancer or prostate cancer, or in situ cervical cancers) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period. Long-term adjuvant therapy (example: breast cancer) is acceptable.
Participants with previous malignancies are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to first treatment and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period as judged by the treating investigator; exceptions include non-melanoma skin cancers, and in situ cancers of any type (e.g. bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast carcinoma in situ)
Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder, gastric, breast, colon or cervical cancers/dysplasia) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry and no additional therapy (other than adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer) is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
Patients with previous nonmelanoma malignancies are excluded unless a complete resection or remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period (exceptions include, but are not limited to, nonmelanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder cancer, in situ gastric cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, in situ colon cancers, in situ cervical cancers/dysplasia, or breast carcinoma in situ)
Patients with second malignancies (except monoclonal B cells of undetermined significance, non-melanomatous skin cancers, papillary thyroid carcinomas, ductal carcinoma in-situ, superficial bladder cancer, prostate cancer or in situ cervical cancers) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to enrollment and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the treatment
Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, endometrial, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry AND no additional therapy is required during the study period.
Patients with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless definitive therapy has been completed at least  year prior to study entry and the patient is now without evidence of disease from that malignancy and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
Subjects with active concurrent malignancies are excluded i.e. cancers other than NSCLC (except non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder, gastric, breast, colon or cervical cancers/dysplasia)
Previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder cancer, in situ gastric or in situ colon cancers, in situ cervical cancers/dysplasia or breast carcinoma in situ) unless a complete remission was achieved at least  year prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
Previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and in situ bladder, gastric, colorectal, endometrial, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast cancers) unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry AND no additional therapy is required during the study period. Other active malignancy\r\nrequiring concurrent intervention
Previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, endometrial, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast) unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry AND no additional therapy is required during the study period
Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and in situ cancers such as the following: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and the following in situ cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, endometrial, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry AND no additional therapy is required during the study period
Subjects with previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder cancer, gastric, or colon cancers or cervical cancers/dysplasia, or breast carcinoma in situ) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
Subjects with previous or active malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, and in situ cancers such as the following: bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or breast) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least  years prior to enrollment and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period
Patients with previous nonmelanoma malignancies are excluded unless a complete resection or remission was achieved at least  years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period (exceptions include, but are not limited to, nonmelanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder cancer, in situ gastric cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, in situ colon cancers, in situ cervical cancers/dysplasia, or breast carcinoma in situ).
