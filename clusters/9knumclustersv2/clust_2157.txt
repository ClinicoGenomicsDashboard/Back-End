Thrombocytopenia:\r\n* Defined as platelet count < ,/mcL\r\n* The patient will have had at least  complete blood counts (CBC) with platelet counts < ,/mcL separated by at least  weeks, and no platelet count >= ,/mcL in the prior  week period, despite () delay or () modification of chemotherapeutic regimen\r\n* A platelet count of > ,/mcL, that follows within  days of a platelet transfusion, will not make the patient ineligible, as long as one or more subsequent platelet counts confirms thrombocytopenia (< ,/mcL)\r\n* Patients have undergone bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, or peripheral blood test in the prior  months, without evidence of leukemia or myelodysplasia by fluorescent in situ-hybridization (FISH)\r\n* Dysplastic changes, based on morphology only, will not exclude the patient if FISH panel for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is normal
