Subject has received treatment with a hypomethylating agent and/or other chemotherapeutic agent either conventional or experimental for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or AML
A hypomethylating agent, venetoclax and/or chemo therapeutic agent for Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Diagnosis of MDS (Myelodysplastic syndromes).
Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with pre-myelodysplastic syndrome (pre-MDS) or MDS on marrow examination (e.g. monosomy )

Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) must have < % blasts in the bone marrow
DIAGNOSIS REQUIREMENT FOR PHASE I PATIENTS: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts (> %) and progressive disease at any time after initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hypomethylator treatment during the past  years, OR failure to achieve complete or partial response or hematological improvement after at least six cycles of azacytidine or four cycles of decitabine administered during the past  years, OR intolerance to azacytidine or decitabine; MDS patients with isolated q- abnormalities that meet these criteria after lenalidomide therapy and DNA hypomethylator therapy are also eligible

History of other active malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), within the past  years (exceptions described in the protocol).
Have received a hypomethylating agent for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Cohort Inclusion Criteria - Group A: Subjects must have previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) according to the WHO classification with no prior treatment other than hydroxyurea. Prior therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative syndromes (MPD), or aplastic anemia is permitted but not with hypomethylating agents.
Patient must not have a concurrent active malignancy for which they are receiving treatment (other than myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS])
Patients may not have undergone any prior therapy for their AML other than hydroxyurea; however, if patients had an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prior treatment with a hypomethylating agent or any other therapy (with the exception of allogeneic stem cell transplant) used to treat their MDS is allowed
Patients with evidence of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or abnormal cytogenetics analysis indicative of MDS on the pre-transplant bone marrow examination
Subject has received treatment with the following hypomethylating agent and/or chemo therapeutic agent for for an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD) (Subjects may have been treated with other agents for AHD i.e., Myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS])
AML with antecedent hematological disease (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, etc.) and not a candidate for stem cell transplantation (SCT) in their current disease state.
AML with antecedent hematological disease (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, etc.) and not a candidate for SCT in their current disease state.
Patients with secondary AML or therapy related disease (t-AML) are eligible; patients who received decitabine or -azacytidine as prior treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remain eligible
Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of non-M AML; antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is acceptable
Subject has active malignant tumors other than AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Previous treatment with chemotherapy (cytarabine, idarubicin, daunorubicin) for a hematological disorder; Exceptions: patients with prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or treatment with hypomethylating agent (azacytidine or decitabine) are not excluded, prior hydroxyurea allowed
Previously untreated AML (except for hydroxyurea and/or corticosteroid therapy for no more than  days (cumulative)). Previous therapy for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is allowed.
Received prior treatment with HMA or chemotherapy for antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
Evidence of second malignancy, abnormal cytogenetics, or morphologic evidence of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
Prior treatment with decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or AML
In blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is acceptable; prior treatment for MDS does not count as an AML therapy.
