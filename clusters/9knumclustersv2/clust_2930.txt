Noncompliance - inability or unwillingness to comply with medical recommendations regarding therapy or follow-up, including smoking tobacco. Smoking cessation is a standard teaching practice prior to admission for all patients undergoing stem cell transplant. Any patient who refuses to stop smoking prior to transplant will not be eligible for this study.
Lifetime pack-year history of <  years, currently non-smoking for at least  years.
Patients must provide their personal smoking history prior to registration; patients cannot have a cumulative personal smoking history that exceeds  pack-years\r\n* Number of pack-years = (frequency of smoking [number of cigarettes per day] x duration of cigarette smoking [years]) / \r\n* Note: Twenty cigarettes is considered equivalent to one pack; cigar and pipe tobacco consumption is not included in calculating lifetime pack-years

Actively smoking  or more cigarettes per day for at least one year

History of smoking either tobacco or other herbal products in the last  months
Patients must provide their personal smoking history prior to registration; the lifetime cumulative history cannot exceed  pack-years; the following formula is used to calculate the pack-years during the periods of smoking in the patients life; the cumulative total of the number of pack-years during each period of active smoking is the lifetime cumulative history\r\n* Number of pack-years = (frequency of smoking [number of cigarettes per day] x duration of cigarette smoking [years])/ \r\n* Note: twenty cigarettes is considered equivalent to one pack; the effect of non-cigarette tobacco products on the survival of patients with p-positive oropharyngeal cancers is undefined; cigar and pipe tobacco consumption is therefore not included in calculating the lifetime pack-years; marijuana consumption is likewise not considered in this calculation; there is no clear scientific evidence regarding the role of chewing tobacco-containing products in this disease; investigators are discouraged from enrolling patients with a history of very sustained use (such as several years or more) of non-cigarette tobacco products alone
