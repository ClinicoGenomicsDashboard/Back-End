Requirement for inotropic support (excluding digoxin) or serious (uncontrolled) cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia)
No history of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions [PVCs], bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation) which is symptomatic or requires treatment (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ) or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; atrial fibrillation, controlled on medication is permitted
Significant cardiovascular disease, including:\r\n* Cardiac failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV\r\n* Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina within  months prior to study day \r\n* History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)\r\n* Cardiac arrhythmia requiring anti-arrhythmic medication(s); note that beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin administered for the purpose rate control of supraventricular tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, are not classified as anti-arrhythmic medications for purposes of trial eligibility
Significant, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia).
Requirement for inotropic support (excluding digoxin) or serious (uncontrolled) cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia).
Unstable ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
History of any of the following within the last  months prior to study entry: requirement of inotropic support; serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia); placement of a pacemaker for control of rhythm
History or presence of atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; the presence or history of ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia), which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade ), symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation despite treatment, or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; patients with atrial fibrillation controlled by medication are permitted
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia), which is symptomatic or requires treatment (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ), symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation despite treatment, or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; patients with atrial fibrillation controlled by medication are permitted
Patient must not have ongoing ventricular cardiac dysrhythmias of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version  grade > ; patients with a history of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or ventricular fibrillation [VF] >  beats in a row) are also excluded; additionally, patients with ongoing atrial fibrillation are not eligible
Requirement for inotropic support (excluding digoxin), or serious (uncontrolled) cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia);
History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. This does not include asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate.
A requirement for positive inotropic support (excluding digoxin) or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation) within  year prior to screening
Participants with a history of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, left bundle branch block) that is symptomatic or requires treatment (except for controlled atrial fibrillation)
A requirement for positive inotropic support (excluding digoxin) or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation) within  year before screening
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions PVCs), bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade ) or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; atrial fibrillation, controlled on medication, is not excluded
Patients with a history of arrhythmia or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia are not eligible. Patients with atrial fibrillation with well-controlled ventricular rate on medication, are eligible.
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions [PVCs], bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation), which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade ) or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; atrial fibrillation, controlled on medication is not excluded
Cardiac dysrhythmia that is potentially life-threatening, such as ventricular tachycardia, multifocal premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular tachycardias with a rapid ventricular response; well-controlled atrial fibrillation or rare (<  minute) premature ventricular contractions are not exclusionary
