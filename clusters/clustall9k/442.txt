Amyloidosis
Patients must have a diagnosis of biopsy-proven diagnosis of AL amyloidosis according to the following standard criteria:\r\n* Histochemical diagnosis of AL amyloidosis, as based on tissue specimens with Congo red staining with exhibition of an apple-green birefringence and immunohistochemistry\r\n* If clinical and laboratory parameters insufficient to establish AL amyloidosis or in cases of doubt, amyloid typing may be necessary\r\n* Measurable disease as defined by serum differential free light chain concentration (dFLC, difference between amyloid forming [involved] and non amyloid forming [uninvolved] free light chain [FLC]) ? 50 mg/L)\r\n* Systemic amyloid organ involvement including renal, cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI) and/or nervous system involvement as well as soft tissue disease
