After prior curative intent treatment for HNC have estimated risk of recurrence >= 40-50% and fall into one of the below categories (A, OR B, OR C, OR D, OR E, OR F); while exact estimation of the risk of recurrence can be difficult the following categories will be included reflecting patients at substantial risk for tumor recurrence or already with early evidence of recurrence:\r\n* A: Any of the below HNC patients are eligible for treatment on this protocol AFTER completion of curative intent therapy:\r\n** HPV(-) HNC: N2C, N3, bulky N2B disease (>= 5 cm LN/tumor conglomerate)\r\n** HPV(+) HNC: N2C, N3, AND >= 10 pack years of tobacco use\r\n** HPV(+) HNC with multilevel nodal involvement, AND bulky N2B disease (>= 5 cm LN/tumor conglomerate), AND >= 10 pack years of tobacco use\r\n** EBV(+) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be eligible if other criteria under A, or alternative criteria B, or C, or D, or E are met\r\n** HNC with supraclavicular or mediastinal nodal involvement (either HPV+/- or EBV+/-) at the time of curative intent treatment and were treated as part of curative intent therapy (e.g. inclusion in the radiation field)\r\n** Residual mass in area of prior tumor that on biopsy does not show residual tumor, is equivocal/not highly-suspicious on imaging (e.g. positron emission tomography/ computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging [PET/CT/MRI]), but remains of concern, requires close follow-up AND is not resected/amenable to resection OR immediate palliative treatment\r\n** Non-responders to induction chemotherapy (progressive disease [PD] on induction, or lack of tumor shrinkage (< 15% per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST])\r\n** Interrupted treatment course or lower than intended radiation dose – i.e. interruption of radiation by >= 3 weeks (cumulative), or delivery of =< 50 Gy as part of a radiation based treatment (that was NOT a de-escalation approach)\r\n* B: Patient treated with salvage treatment (i.e. salvage surgery or re-irradiation) for residual or recurrent tumor after prior radiation based therapy (either HPV+ or HPV- or EBV+) AND not a candidate for additional curative intent therapy (for various reasons including poor performance status, comorbidities, refusal of patient, prior radiation or re-irradiation, etc); positive margins or residual tumor may still be acceptable); patients should also not be appropriate for systemic palliative therapy (e.g. in the case of overt disease)\r\n* C: Mx or indeterminate distant lesions that are not appropriate for either local radiation/stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment and also not appropriate for initiation of palliative system therapy (e.g. in the setting of overt metastatic disease); such lesions should be negative/equivocal by PET imaging and if amenable negative by biopsy, but remain of concern and require close follow-up\r\n* D: Oligometastatic disease treated with SBRT or other curative-intent therapy (e.g. surgery or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), etc) for oligometastatic disease\r\n* E: Microscopic or very low volume residual tumor after surgery or radiation based treatment (including salvage treatment or SBRT for oligometastatic disease), AND not a candidate for either additional curative intent therapy (for various reasons including feasibility, poor performance status, comorbidities, refusal of patient, prior radiation or re-irradiation, etc) AND also not a candidate for systemic palliative therapy (for various reasons including microscopic/non-[RECIST] measurable low volume disease); very low volume disease is defined as non-RECIST measurable)\r\n* F: Patients with multiple recurrences or multiple primaries: specifically patients who had malignant or pre-malignant tumors/changes (with severe dysplasia present), who have undergone surgery >= 2 times, and currently do not have an indication for additional (adjuvant) treatment such as radiation, or surgery, or other treatment; this may include multiple recurrences/incidences of early stage tumors or premalignant lesions, however at least one lesion needs to show squamous cell carcinoma on pathology\r\n* There may be additional scenarios for patients that are considered very high risk for disease recurrence and not appropriate for either curative or standard of care palliative therapy; such patients can be considered for enrollment after discussion and approval by the principal investigator (PI) and/or co-PI

Other prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for local or organ confined early stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent or does not require treatment, does not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of active disease and has a negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the endpoints of the study
