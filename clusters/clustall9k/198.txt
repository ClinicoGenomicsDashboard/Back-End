FOR PDX-GUIDED THERAPY THROUGH ONGOING TRIALS AT MD ANDERSON OR OFF-PROTOCOL WITH STANDARD OF CARE (PART 2): The patient condition remains suitable for the selected therapy.

THE PATIENT IS INELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PART 2 IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR: Part 1 data contradict clinical judgment. The investigator should discuss with the principal investigator (PI) and use the best discretion.

Patient is premenopausal defined as either:
Patient had last menstrual period within the last 12 months or
Patient must have:
Respiratory illness requiring hospitalization at the time of step 1 registration\r\n* Note: if the respiratory illness is resolved and the patient meets the eligibility status above, then the patient can be considered for the trial

Patients who speak English (or read one of the languages for which a translation is available must consent to complete the mandatory dysphagia-related patient reported instrument (MDADI); if the patient cannot understand spoken English and reads only languages not available in the MDADI translations, the patient can still participate in the trial, as this has been factored into the trial statistics; for all other patients, the MDADI is mandatory as it is included in the primary endpoint to be studied

Donors: If a patient is homozygous at a particular loci, mismatching at that loci is not allowed due to an isolated graft rejection vector, i.e., patient A*0101 and the donor is A*0101, A*0201; such a mismatch may increase the risk of graft rejection; if patient and donor pairs are both homozygous at a mismatched loci, they are considered a two-HLA antigen mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0201, and this type of mismatch is not allowed
Potential patients referred for the study may not be eligible for the experimental protocol therapy due to reasons such as uncertainty about donor HLA typing or need to control malignant disease, infection, or metabolic abnormality such as hypercalcemia on an emergent basis; should a referred patient present to us in such a scenario, the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for treatment; however, if referral back to the referring physician is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease or complicating conditions (infection, metabolic problems) under the current study; in other cases, a patient may have reasonable control of malignancy but does not meet the CD4 cell cut-off of 100 cells per microliter required for cohort 3 therapy (or, absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] value of < 300); in such cases, standard care chemotherapy regimens may be administered for the specific goal of reducing the CD4 count (that is, immune depleting regimens such as the pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide combination, administered similar to the manner that we have developed on protocol 08-C-0088); if it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to experimental therapy, then he/she must come off study; recipient-subjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol; because such standard care therapy is not experimental, it is not necessary to complete the eligibility criteria prior to receiving such standard care; however, prior to initiation of the experimental therapy, the patient must meet each of the eligibility criteria detailed above; attempts will be made to standardize such pre-transplant chemotherapy (by administration of EPOCH-FR chemotherapy); however, other regimens using approved agents will be allowed if such regimens are thought to be in the best interest of the patient

Patient is considered a poor surgical candidate for removal of a renal mass as determined by pre-operative assessment due to the following factors or various combinations thereof:\r\n* Significant comorbidity precluding ability to deliver anesthesia, without compromised ability to undergo systemic chemotherapy with pazopanib as deemed by the Urologist and Medical Oncologist \r\n* Medically documented contraindication for surgery due to religion or risk of blood transfusion\r\n* Size or location of tumor deemed high risk for surgical intervention by Urologist\r\n* Unacceptable risk for anesthesia, such as history of malignant hyperthermia\r\n* Any one of these factors may or may not constitute unresectability, but for consideration for this trial, the surgical and medical oncologist must agree that the particular constellation of findings for the patient under consideration would likely entail a low probability (< 50%) that the tumor would be resectable (with negative margins) or that the potential morbidity associated with an attempt at surgical resection would not be clinically acceptable\r\n* The numerical thresholds noted above are only a guideline and the clinical judgment of the surgeon and medical oncologist will determine unresectability or if patient refuses surgery or other forms of local therapy; the histopathology for this cohort is limited to clear cell carcinoma of the kidney
