Patient with rapidly escalating pain that require hospitalization or an intravenous opioid therapy
Chronic narcotic pain medication user
Unremitting pain that resulted in a return visit to the oncologist. The 'worst pain' in the last 24 hours must be reported to be 4 or above on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as subject can imagine) despite pharmaceutical pain management
Stable use of pain medications (no changes within 2 weeks prior to the cryoablation procedure)
History of chronic pain, long-term narcotic use or being considered for chronic pain consultation postoperatively
Any condition that causes severe pain with exertion
Pain or significant arthritis in the toes of either foot;
Able to walk at least 2 blocks without chest pain, dyspnea, shortness of breath or fainting
CONTROL (HEALTHY) GROUP: Able to walk at least 2 blocks without chest pain, dyspnea, shortness of breath or fainting
Any hematologic disorder involving platelets or clotting abnormalities or any condition requiring treatment with transfusions, anticoagulants except platelet inhibitors (NSAIDs as needed for pain are permitted)
Patients who are not awake, not alert, or who cannot express pain or discomfort related to the catheter locks
Signs and symptoms of localized catheter-related infection (tenderness and/or pain, erythema, swelling, purulent exudates within 2 cm of entry site)
Willingness to self-report level of oral pain using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Normalcy Diet Scale (NDS) throughout each stomatitis event, as required in the patient diary. At baseline, patient's self-reported oral pain level, using VAS, must be 0 and the normalcy diet scale score should ? 60
New onset of chest pain or arrhythmia in the past 2 months
Chest pain, angina, or heart failure
Pain in supine position
Uncontrolled tumor-related pain: patients requiring narcotic pain medication must be on a stable regimen at registration; symptomatic lesions (e.g., bone metastases or metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be treated prior to randomization; patients should be recovered from the effects of radiation; there is no required minimum recovery period; asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis that is not presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to randomization
GROUP B (no pain group): Must either have subjective symptoms of painless neuropathy (loss of sensation, worsening balance, strange sensation in fingers and/or toes) or no complaints related to neuropathy
Has pain rated 50 or higher on a scale of 0-100, with 0 = no pain at all and 100 = worst pain imaginable on the day of the first DLss test
Presence of pain that developed or worsened since breast cancer diagnosis (not specifically due to an identifiable trauma [eg fracture or injury]) and has been present for at least 3 months; average pain must be at least 4 on a 0-10 scale over the past 7 days
Thumbnail abnormalities on either hand (such as due to chemotherapy or trauma, or artificial nails) that are likely to alter pain perception during testing
Significant symptom burden from presumed diagnosis including large volume ascites, pain requiring narcotic medication, or shortness of breath on exertion
Significant symptom burden from presumed diagnosis including large volume ascites, pain requiring narcotic medication, or shortness of breath on exertion
Poorly-controlled pain with a self-reported pain score of 7/10 at the time of enrollment (PCS study)
Patients who are unable to validate their understanding of the pain scale
Nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain or altered bowel habit
Neuropathy with or without pain
Significant neurotoxicity (Grade 2 with pain or higher) at the time of enrolment

With otolaryngeal cancer receiving surgery with general anesthesia\r\n* Please note we are purposefully including patients with higher predisposition to delirium as we are investigating potential preventive strategies for this diagnosis of multiple etiologies; patients at higher risk of delirium (e.g., advanced age, chronic hypertension) will be included in our study; additionally, other common risk factors that exist in this patient population (e.g., alcohol or nicotine use) are thought to contribute to delirium postoperatively
Part 1: patients will be excluded if (1) have clinical evidence of cognitive failure as evidenced by Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score of ? 13 at baseline
Delirium (i.e., score >13 on the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale; range 1-30).
Delirium (i.e. Memorial Delirium Rating Scale > 13)
PATIENTS: Hyperactive or mixed delirium with RASS >= 1 in the past 24 hours (h)
Memorial Delirium Rating Scale > 13
Delirium (i.e., Memorial Delirium Rating Scale > 13)
Delirium (i.e. memorial delirium rating scale > 13)
Cognitive impairment with a Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) score of 7 or higher or diagnosed with neurocognitive impairment by the treating SCC physician
Presence of relatively intact cognition defined by normal memorial delirium assessment scale (< 7/30); sign written informed consent
Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale > 13/30
Patients must have no clinical evidence of cognitive impairment as determined by the palliative care physician (Memorial Delirium Assessment Score >= 7)
Hyperactive/mixed delirium with RASS >= 2 in the last 24 hours
At the patient’s bedside at least 4 hours each day during patient delirium episode
Delirium (i.e. memorial delirium rating scale > 13)
Delirium (i.e. Memorial delirium rating scale > 13)

Memorial delirium assessment scale =< 13
Have no clinical evidence of cognitive failure as evidenced by Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) score of =< 13 at baseline
Memorial delirium assessment scale =< 13
Altered cognition (as assessed routinely in the Supportive Care Clinic using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale [MDAS], with a score of >= 7/30)
Patients with normal cognitive status (Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale [MDAS] =< 6/30) who are able to understand the nature and purpose of the study and have the ability to complete the consent process
