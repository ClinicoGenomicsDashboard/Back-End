Patient's nutritional and general physical condition must be considered compatible with the proposed radiotherapeutic treatment (cannot have unintentional and/or surgically unrelated weight loss > 20% in the preceding 3 months); this assessment is a standard of care assessment for this patient population; this requirement can be waived by the investigator if the subject has an identifiable procedure which is the immediate and sole cause for the weight loss without an underlying pathological cause; an example of a situation like this would be if a participant is found to need a tonsillectomy during the pretreatment evaluations; it’s obvious that this scenario would be a non-pathological reason for such a weight loss; the Principal Investigator (PI) will only have this ability to waive this criterion if and only if he can substantiate and document that the weight loss does not have a pathological etiology and will correct itself within a reasonable and acceptable period of time
