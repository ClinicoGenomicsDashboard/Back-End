Patient’s with a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria must have < grade 3 proteinuria per NCI CTCAE v4.0 at screening; if a patient has a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria, a urine protein test will be performed on a random urine sample; if the result is normal then no additional testing is required; if the result is abnormal, a 24 hour urine will be collected to determine if proteinuria is < grade 3
Patient’s with a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria must have < grade 3 proteinuria per NCI CTCAE v4.0 at screening; if a patient has a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria, a urine protein test will be performed on a random urine sample; if the result is normal then no additional testing is required; if the result is abnormal, a 24 hour urine will be collected to determine if proteinuria is < grade 3
Patient’s with a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria must have < grade 3 proteinuria per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 at screening; if a patient has a history of kidney disease or persistent proteinuria, a urine protein test will be performed on a random urine sample; if the result is normal then no additional testing is required; if the result is abnormal, a 24 hour urine will be collected to determine if proteinuria is < grade 3
Patients with 2+ proteinuria/moderate or more at baseline are ineligible
Patient must not have known proteinuria >= 500mg/24 hours
Greater than 2+ proteinuria on two consecutive dipsticks taken no less than 1 week apart or 24-hour urine protein of > 1 g; patients with < 2+ proteinuria are eligible following initial determination by urinalysis within 1 week prior to enrollment and do not need the urinalysis repeated
