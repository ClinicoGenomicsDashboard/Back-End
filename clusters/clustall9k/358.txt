Subjects with urothelial carcinoma:
Adequately treated urothelial papillary non-invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ
For Phase 2, subjects with the following tumor types who meet protocol-defined criteria: advanced or metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, SCCHN, SCLC, and CRC.
Patients with any component of small cell carcinoma are not eligible; other variant histologies are permitted provided the predominant (>= 50%) subtype is urothelial carcinoma
Patients must be able to provide a sufficient biopsy sample to the central pathologist for histopathologically confirmed, transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma. Urothelial tumors with mixed histology (but with <50% variant) are eligible.
Any primary site of urothelial carcinoma including upper tract, renal pelvis, bladder, and ureters
Prior therapy with ? 1 systemic chemotherapy regimens for urothelial carcinoma
Pathologically proven diagnosis of carcinoma of the bladder within 105 days prior to registration\r\n* Operable patients whose initial tumor is a primary high grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder exhibiting histologic evidence of invasion into the lamina propria (disease clinical stage T1) or a high grade stage Ta urothelial carcinoma without hydronephrosis; patients who have involvement of the prostatic urethra with urothelial carcinoma and have no evidence of stromal invasion of the prostate remain eligible; if the patient’s initial tumor was a high grade stage Ta urothelial carcinoma then his/her recurrent tumor must be a high grade stage T1 urothelial carcinoma to be eligible
Urothelial Carcinoma
The patient must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of urothelial BLC, which is currently Stage 4 disease.
A patient with urothelial carcinoma with variant histologic differentiation (e.g. squamous cell differentiation, glandular differentiation, neuroendocrine differentiation) will be eligible provided that the predominant histology is urothelial carcinoma.
Patient must have a diagnosis with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with clinically apparent tumor Ta, G1-G2.
Patients must have histologically-proven (T2, T3, or T4a) urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) that requires primary radical cystectomy for definitive treatment; patients must not have clinical stage consistent with a low-risk of node metastasis (carcinoma in situ [CIS] only, T1); patients with a T4b (fixed lesion) are not eligible for this study; NOTE: Patients with predominant urothelial carcinoma with elements of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, micropapillary or minor components of other rare phenotypes are eligible; patients with predominantly small cell, squamous cell, or adenocarcinoma histologies are not eligible; patients with other non-urothelial cancers are not eligible (e.g., sarcoma, lymphoepithelial, nested variant); clinical stage is based on all of the following: transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s) (TURBT[s]) that determined the need for cystectomy, bimanual exam and cross sectional imaging
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial tract carcinoma
Histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma.
Patients must have undergone a radical cystectomy (reconstructed urinary diversion may be non-continent diversions (eg, ileal conduits) or continent non-orthotopic catheterizable diversions (eg, Indiana pouch) or continent orthotopic diversions (eg, Studer pouch or neobladder) for urothelial bladder carcinoma within 105 days prior to registration; final cystectomy pathology must be either pure urothelial carcinoma or dominant urothelial carcinoma with admixture of other histologies excluding small cell variants\r\n* Neoadjuvant (preoperative) or adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy for the bladder cancer is permitted; however, all patients, even those who will receive adjuvant chemotherapy must be registered within 105 days after completing cystectomy regardless of whether adjuvant chemotherapy has started; patients who will then receive adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy will be randomized within 28 days of completing chemotherapy
Diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma
Participants must have received prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. NOTE: Up to 2 prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimens given in the metastatic disease setting for urothelial carcinoma are allowed.
Histologically proven recurrent urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or prostatic urethra, Stage Tis, Ta
Pure small cell histologic variant or other pure non-urothelial carcinomas
Prior systemic chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Any other prior systemic chemotherapy for a non-urothelial carcinoma must have been completed > 5 years prior to initiation of study.
Any male or female patient diagnosed with incident or recurrent Urothelial Cell Carcinoma and undergoing surveillance at 3 month intervals.
Has had all urothelial cell carcinoma tumor resected within the past 12 months
Planning to undergo radical cystectomy or chemotherapy-radiation for Urothelial Cell Carcinoma
Must have diagnosis of urothelial cancer
Histologic or imaging evidence of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder
Urothelial cancer.
Malignancies other than urothelial carcinoma within 5 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1
Clinical stage T2-T4a, N0, M0 urothelial bladder cancer
