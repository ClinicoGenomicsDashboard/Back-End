Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive
Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for HCV RNA or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen);
Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or C virus (HCV) infection; or known to be positive for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen)
Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B virus surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is detected)\r\n* Note: the following will not be exclusionary:\r\n** A positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., HBsAb positive and hepatitis B virus core antibody [HBcAb] negative), or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection \r\n** Patients with chronic HBV suppressed by appropriate antiretroviral therapy with activity against HBV, as outlined in Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines\r\n** Positive HCV serology but no detectable HCV RNA, indicative of spontaneously cleared HCV infection\r\n** Patients who have been successfully treated for HCV as long as therapy for HCV has been completed
Has documented positive results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody with detectable HCV ribonucleic acid, or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) within 90 days before randomization
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening (positive HBV surface antigen or HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] if anti-HCV antibody screening test positive)
Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active or chronic hepatitis (i.e., quantifiable hepatitis B virus [HBV]-deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HbsAg], quantifiable hepatitis C virus [HCV]-ribonucleic acid [RNA]) or known history of HCV or HBV without documented resolution; testing for hepatitis B or other infections for eligibility will be performed only if clinically indicated
