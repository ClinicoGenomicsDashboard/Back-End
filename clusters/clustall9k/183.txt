The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in consultation with the investigator; women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives; the half-life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug; WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product
Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year the investigator shall review contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed; men who are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives; the half-life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively; therefore, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug
Negative serum or urine pregnancy test in women with childbearing potential (WOCBP) defined as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization, within one week prior to initiation of treatment; WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of contraception; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug; WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal; menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes; women who are not of childbearing potential are not required to use contraception
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of contraception; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug
