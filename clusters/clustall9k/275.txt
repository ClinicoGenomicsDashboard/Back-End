(Patients may receive maintenance therapy with drugs that are not proteasome inhibitors or CD38 antibodies during this 6-month carfilzomib treatment free interval)
Subjects must have been treated with at least 2 prior therapies including a proteasome inhibitor and a cereblon-binding agent\r\n* Subjects who are refractory to carfilzomib may enroll throughout the trial; carfilzomib refractory status is defined by IMWG criteria: disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course\r\n* In the twice weekly dosing cohort of the study, enrollment will be limited to patients meeting carfilzomib refractory status\r\n* In the weekly dosing cohort, it will be required that one of the expansion cohorts (20 subjects) enrolls carfilzomib refractory subjects and the other (20 subjects) enrolls carfilzomib/proteasome inhibitor (PI) naive/sensitive subjects
Male patients must agree not to donate semen or sperm while they are taking carfilzomib and 28 days after the last carfilzomib dose.
Patients may not have received any prior carfilzomib treatment
Patient must have been eligible for and initially randomized to Arm 1 (low dose carfilzomib), begun cycle 2 of treatment, and progressed prior to completing 12 cycles of protocol therapy
Patients must have begun cycle 2 (carfilzomib – 27 mg/m^2) and must not have received any dose reduction for toxicity in the last cycle of treatment, immediately preceding progression
Subject must have received a regimen containing carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone as their most recent line of therapy and have:
For carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) regimen: newly diagnosed myeloma. For carfilzomib-dexamethasone (CFZ-dex) regimen: relapsed or refractory disease
Subjects with relapsed/refractory MM who have received at least two prior lines of therapy including lenalidomide and either bortezomib or carfilzomib and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of the completion of the most recent treatment regimen.
Any prior treatment with carfilzomib
Prior treatment with carfilzomib or oprozomib
Is refractory to VELCADE or another PI, like ixazomib and carfilzomib (had progression of disease while receiving VELCADE therapy or within 60 days of ending VELCADE therapy or another PI therapy, like ixazomib and carfilzomib
Prior treatment with either carfilzomib or oprozomib
Prior therapy with carfilzomib if discontinued due to toxicity
Intolerance to previous bendamustine, carfilzomib or dexamethasone or mannitol; subjects who are allergic to bortezomib are not excluded
Prior dose limiting toxicity from carfilzomib or lenalidomide
Prior carfizolmib is not required but is allowed if a patient had at least 2 cycles of carfilzomib alone or in combination with a dose of at least 20/27 mg/m2, as long as the patient :
Had at least a partial response to prior carfilzomib therapy
Was not removed from carfilzomib therapy due to toxicity, unless approved by the medical monitor
Male subjects must agree not to donate semen or sperm while taking lenalidomide and/or carfilzomib and 28 days after the last lenalidomide/carfilzomib dose
Patients should be proteasome inhibitor naive (including bortezomib and carfilzomib) OR have received less than 6 cycles of therapy with a bortezomib or carfilzomib containing regimen and were not refractory to the bortezomib or carfilzomib based regimen (less than a PR or progression on or within 60 days of discontinuation)
Confirmed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) or plasma cell leukemia (PCL); patients should have received at least 1 prior treatment regimen; prior treatment must have included at least one full cycle of a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib) and at least one full cycle of an immunomodulatory (IMiD) (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide or pomalidomide); patients who have had prior ARRY-520 and carfilzomib will be allowed in the dose escalation phase, however prior ARRY-520 and carfilzomib will be excluded in the dose expansion cohort 1 of part A; there will be 2 cohorts in the dose expansion of part A: cohort 1 will be patients who are carfilzomib sensitive; cohort 2 will be patients who are carfilzomib refractory
Patients who have received any previous carfilzomib treatment
Prior treatment with carfilzomib, filanesib, or any other KSP inhibitor.
Known hypersensitivity to carfilzomib
Subjects must have progressed on standard dose/schedule of carfilzomib without having had any carfilzomib related grade 3 or 4 toxicities
Prior therapy with carfilzomib is allowed as long as the patient had at least a PR to prior carfilzomib therapy, was not removed from carfilzomib therapy due to toxicity, and had at least a 6-month carfilzomib treatment-free interval from last dose received until first study treatment. (Patients may receive maintenance therapy with drugs that are not in the proteasome inhibitor class during this 6 month carfilzomib treatment-free interval). The exception to this is patients randomized or previously randomized in any other Onyx-Sponsored Phase 3 trial.
c. carfilzomib. Demonstrated disease progression on or within 60d of completion of carfilzomib therapy
Prior carfilzomib treatment
Not received carfilzomib within 6 months (183 days) of Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), and
Carfilzomib was not part of their most recent therapy for the treatment of MM, and
Did not discontinue carfilzomib treatment because of adverse effects.
For Concomitant Treatment: No prior treatment with MRZ or any other PIs, including BTZ, carfilzomib (CFZ), or ixazomib (IXZ)
