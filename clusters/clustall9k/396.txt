Serum creatinine OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance within normal institutional limits; glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance (CrCl) within normal institutional limits as adjusted for age and sex
Serum creatinine: =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min for participant with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN (using Cockcroft-Gault equation), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance (CrCl)
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) >= 60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 x institutional upper limits of normal (ULN), obtained within 14 days prior to C11-AMT PET scan
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) >= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN, obtained =< 30 days prior to registration
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] can also be used in place of creatinine or creatinine clearance [CrCl]) >= 60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 x institutional ULN
