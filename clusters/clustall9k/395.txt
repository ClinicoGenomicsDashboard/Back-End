Pre-imaging laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days prior to the [18F] FLT imaging procedure; these must be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry into the study (unless clinically not relevant); in those instances where a laboratory value is outside of this range, then such a patient will be ineligible for enrollment; for follow-up scanning sessions after therapy has been instituted, laboratory testing will also be required due to the use of [18F] FLT; the patients have brain tumors and will have received chemoradiation; therefore, many routine laboratory tests may not be within the typical normal range; as such, a factor of 4.0 times above or below the upper or lower value for the normal range for any laboratory test will also be used to determine the acceptable range for the 2nd and possibly 3rd imaging time points (unless clinically not relevant); the baseline laboratory testing will include liver enzymes (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), bilirubin (total), serum electrolytes, complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine; for those patients receiving coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range
