Archival tissue is\n        required for Arms B and C.\n\n        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n        composition to ONC201 or its excipients.\n\n        Current or planned participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an\n        investigational device.\n\n        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n        infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study\n        requirements.\n\n        Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n\n        Prior stereotactic radiotherapy, convection enhanced delivery (CED) or brachytherapy must\n        have had a biopsy to confirm radiographic progression is consistent with progressive tumor\n        and not treatment-related necrosis. If the recurrent lesion is outside of any prior\n        high-dose radiation target volume or distant from the prior CED or brachytherapy site,\n        subjects will be considered eligible\n\n        Pregnant women because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or\n        abortifacient effects.

Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell\n        carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative\n        therapy.\n\n        Any surgery (not including minor diagnostic procedures such as lymph node biopsy) within 2\n        weeks of baseline disease assessments; or not fully recovered from any side effects of\n        previous procedures.\n\n        Concomitant use of CYP3A4/5 inhibitors during the treatment phase of the study and within\n        72 hours prior to starting study drug administration.\n\n        Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inducers, which include enzyme inducing antiepileptic\n        drugs (EIAEDs) (see Appendix B), during the treatment phase of the study and within 2 weeks\n        prior to starting treatment.\n\n        Planned concurrent use Optune™. Prior use of the device is allowable.\n\n        For Arm D: Evidence of leptomeningeal spread of disease.

Manipulated B-CLL cells available (at least 6 injections)
CIRS ? 6; 2. Creatinine Clearance < 70 mL/min; 3. Subject is not a candidate for a chemoimmunotherapy in the opinion of investigator. ii. Treatment with an approved BTK inhibitor is not required if subject has contraindications or is not a candidate for such a therapy in the opinion of the investigator. b. For Arm B, subjects with treatment-naïve or R/R CLL must meet the following criteria: i. Dose Escalation Phase: Subjects must not have received prior treatment with ibrutinib (or any other approved BTK inhibitors) and must have either R/R CLL or treatment naïve (ie, first-line) CLL if the subject:
is unfit for standard chemoimmunotherapy meeting at least 1 of the following co-morbidity criteria: a. CIRS ? 6; b. Creatinine Clearance < 70 mL/min; c. Subject is not a candidate for a chemoimmunotherapy in the opinion of the investigator. The reason for not being a candidate must be documented in CRF. ii. Dose Expansion Phase: Subjects must not have received prior treatment with ibrutinib (or any other approved BTK inhibitors) and must have high risk CLL. High risk is defined as: 1) 17p- and/or TP53 mutation positive in treatment naïve CLL; or 2) 17p- and/or TP53 mutation positive, and/or complex karyotype, and/or progression < 24 months after completion of 1st line chemoimmunotherapy in R/R CLL c. Subjects with R/R SLL or CLL with bulky disease (at least one lymph node measuring > 5.0 cm in diameter) are considered at higher risk for developing a TFR and may only be enrolled upon discussion with the sponsor's medical monitor and agreement to close medical management.
SLL / CLL SUBJECTS:
Intermediate or High risk, poor prognosis CLL/SLL
CLL and NHL Subjects:
CLL or SLL patients only (does not apply to MBL patients): Rai stage 0-1 (both CLL and SLL patients can be staged using the Rai system)
Patients must be previously untreated and must NOT have any of the following indications for chemotherapy:\r\n* Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of or worsening anemia (=< 11 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (=< 100 x 10^9/L) not due to autoimmune disease\r\n* Symptomatic or progressive lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly\r\n* One or more of the following disease-related symptoms:\r\n** Weight loss >= 10% within the previous 6 months\r\n** Extreme fatigue attributed to CLL\r\n** Fevers > 100.4 degree Fahrenheit (o^F) for 2 weeks without evidence of infection\r\n** Drenching night sweats without evidence of infection\r\nNote: 1) Prior chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody based therapy for treatment of CLL or SLL will be considered prior therapy; nutraceutical treatments with no established benefit in CLL (such as epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG, found in green tea or other herbal treatments) will not be considered “prior treatment”\r\n2) Prior corticosteroid therapy for an indication other than CLL/SLL will not be considered “prior treatment”; previous use of corticosteroids for treatment of autoimmune complications of CLL/SLL does not constitute prior therapy for CLL/SLL
