History of smoking either tobacco or other herbal products in the last 3 months
Patients must provide their personal smoking history prior to registration; the lifetime cumulative history cannot exceed 10 pack-years; the following formula is used to calculate the pack-years during the periods of smoking in the patientâ€™s life; the cumulative total of the number of pack-years during each period of active smoking is the lifetime cumulative history\r\n* Number of pack-years = (frequency of smoking [number of cigarettes per day] x duration of cigarette smoking [years])/20 \r\n* Note: twenty cigarettes is considered equivalent to one pack; the effect of non-cigarette tobacco products on the survival of patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers is undefined; cigar and pipe tobacco consumption is therefore not included in calculating the lifetime pack-years; marijuana consumption is likewise not considered in this calculation; there is no clear scientific evidence regarding the role of chewing tobacco-containing products in this disease; investigators are discouraged from enrolling patients with a history of very sustained use (such as several years or more) of non-cigarette tobacco products alone
