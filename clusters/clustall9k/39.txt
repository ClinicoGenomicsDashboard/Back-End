For dose escalation cohorts: Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors are eligible. Subjects' tumors (all comers) must be refractory to standard treatment with no standard therapy available, or subjects actively refuse any treatment, which would be regarded standard. In addition, the investigator must judge the experimental treatment as clinically and ethically acceptable
Patients with a malignancy that is either refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.
Part 1 only: Patients with histologically or cytologically proven progressive or metastatic solid tumors who have failed standard treatment and have no other effective treatment available. Part 2 only: Patients with histologically or cytologically proven progressive or metastatic solid tumors who have failed standard treatment and have no other effective treatment available, or docetaxel-naive patients who have failed standard treatment and have tumors for which a docetaxel-based regimen would be appropriate.
Arm 1 only: Histologically confirmed malignant solid tumor which is refractory to or has failed standard treatments, or participant is not considered medically suitable to receive standard of care treatment or refuses standard of care treatment
Pathologically documented, definitively diagnosed, advanced solid tumor that is refractory to standard treatment, or which no standard therapy is available, or the subject refuses standard therapy or multiple myeloma
Pathologically confirmed solid tumor, locally advanced / metastatic, refractory after standard therapy, or for which no effective curative or surgical treatment options are available
Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors known to express C4.4a (eg, carcinomas of the lung, head & neck SCC, esophagus SCC (squamous cell carcinoma),colon, ovary, prostate, and breast) that are refractory to any standard therapy, or have no standard therapy available, or for which subjects actively refuse any treatment that would be regarded as standard and in whom, in the opinion of the investigator, experimental therapy with BAY1129980 may be beneficial.
Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed advanced/metastatic solid tumor or lymphoma that is refractory to standard therapies, or the patient refuses standard therapy
Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exist
Patients with advanced cancer should be refractory to standard therapy, relapsed after standard therapy, or have no standard therapy that improves survival by at least three months
Histologically or cytologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors or recurrent malignant lymphoma in subjects who failed standard therapy or for whom standard or curative therapy does not exist or is not tolerable.
locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with the exception of primary brain tumor, and have failed or are not eligible for standard of care therapy.
Patients with advanced cancer, either refractory to standard therapy or for which no effective standard therapy that increases survival for at least 3 months if available
Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (non-hematologic refractory to or relapsed from standard therapies or for which there is no known effective treatment during dose escalation
Patients with confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumors (dose-escalation phase) or another solid tumor type based on antitumoral activity (dose-expansion phase) that are not responsive to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists
Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer that is refractory to standard therapy, relapsed after standard therapy, or has no standard therapy that improves survival by at least three months
Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that has recurred after standard therapy, or for which there is no standard therapy. Subjects with brainstem glioma DO NOT need histologic proof of the diagnosis.
