Progression following a single line of prior cytotoxic therapy including a platinum agent plus a standard cytotoxic partner other than a taxane (typically pemetrexed, gemcitabine or vinorelbine):\r\n* Previous treatment with targeted therapy will not count as a prior line of therapy if the patient’s tumor has the relevant molecular change (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutation for erlotinib and echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 [EML4]/anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] or receptor tyrosine kinase [ROS1] for crizotinib)\r\n* Previous treatment with immune-oncologic agents (such as nivolumab) will not count as a prior line of therapy
Tumors with driver mutations (epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive or anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive) should have had disease progression or been intolerant to the standard tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI), and should include a second line TKI where such therapy is available and indicated.
Patients known to be positive for activating Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation
Persons with tumors known to have biomarkers predictive of resistance to erlotinib therapy (specifically Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [KRAS] mutations, anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] gene rearrangements, and EGFR T790M mutations) will be ineligible for study participation; if the results of molecular studies are not available or known at the time of study registration and subsequently become available, such participants will be considered eligible and if deriving clinical benefit may continue receiving erlotinib at the discretion of the investigator and study chair
Lung adenocarcinoma with an Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement
Patients with known activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene or anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) or c-ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS-1) (this test [ROS-1] will be done only on select patients and at the discretion of treating physicians) translocation positive; the mutational status of all patients will be determined prior to study entry
Tumor without activating driver mutations for which there is available therapy (eg, tumor without mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma).
In countries where anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors are available for the treatment of NSCLC, subjects need to have been screened for ALK fusion gene rearrangements and excluded if positive, unless previously treated and progressed on an appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy
Patients with targetable mutation i.e. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), must have been treated with at least 1 prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
Patients must have received at least one platinum-containing regimen for the treatment of advanced or metastatic disease (except for epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]-mutant patients); prior maintenance therapy is allowed and will be considered as the same line of therapy when continued without discontinuation after initiation of a treatment regimen; NSCLC with documented EGFR mutation will be eligible after progression on an EGFR-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) alone; NSCLC with other molecular targets, such as fusion gene involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene (such as echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 [EML4]-ALK) or ROS proto-oncogene 1 , receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS-1), will be eligible if they have progressed on targeted agents (ALK inhibitor) and chemotherapy or are not a candidate for chemotherapy
The institution’s pre-enrollment biomarker screening at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab documents presence of known “sensitive” mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR TK) domain (exon 19 deletion, L858) and/or EML4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion arrangement; either the primary tumor or the metastatic lymph node tissue may be used for testing of mutations
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations
LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA COHORT (COHORT 3 ONLY): Patients must have had at least one prior therapy for advanced disease (platinum-containing chemotherapy or one of the approved targeted therapies [an approved epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for EGFR mutant tumors or crizotinib and ceritinib for anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) translocated tumors]); there is no limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received
Failed or were intolerant to at least one prior systemic treatment regimen with oral or IV medications and have no additional therapy options known to prolong survival with the exception of PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade therapy for subjects who will be enrolled in treatment arm A. Subjects with non-small cell lung cancer must have received at least one platinum doublet regimen. Subjects with known epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement must have also exhausted approved targeted therapy options;
Known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutated disease (molecular testing not required prior to study entry)
There will be no limit on number of prior therapies for NSCLC; patients with previously untreated NSCLC will be eligible if they are uninterested in or ineligible for standard first line chemotherapy; patients with NSCLC known to harbor an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation known to be sensitive to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), are only eligible after experiencing disease progression (during or after treatment) or intolerance to an FDA approved EGFR TKI or ALK TKI, respectively
Subject with a tumor of non-squamous histology must be tested for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement. Subject with EGFR activating mutation or ALK rearrangement must have experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity/intolerance after receiving at least one EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or ALK inhibitor;
Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overactivity mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements must have received tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy prior to consideration for enrollment;
Radiographic disease recurrence or progression during or after front-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. For patients with known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations, appropriate targeted treatment should have been used. Mutation testing is not required.
For participants with a documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, one additional line of non-cytotoxic prior treatment will be permitted provided the therapy is a targeted agent against the EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement.
Presence of an activating EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation or ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) translocation in the tumor.
Known presence of documented sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation or echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) translocation (screening following local standards, but strongly encouraged in non-squamous histology)
Patients with any known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and/or anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) translocation
NSCLC with documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation associated with response to EGFR inhibitors or documented fusion gene involving anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene
Participants with sALCL must have documented anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status and must be beyond first remission or refractory to front-line chemotherapy
Documented anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status.
No prior treatment for Stage IV non-squamous or squamous NSCLC. Participant known to have a sensitizing mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene are excluded from the study
Participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic alternations should have PD on prior US-FDA approved therapy for these aberrations.
