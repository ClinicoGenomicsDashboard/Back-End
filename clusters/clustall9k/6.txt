DONOR: If there is more than one donor with the least amount of HVG allele mismatches, the following prioritization will be used: (will always minimize HVG mismatch as highest priority)\r\n* ABO compatibility (in order of priority)\r\n** Compatible or minor ABO incompatibility\r\n** Major ABO incompatibility\r\n* Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status\r\n** The CMV status of the pair donor-recipient is frequently employed to select a potential donor; this is a controversial issue and the data available is somewhat limited; the following guidelines are recommended:\r\n*** For a CMV seronegative recipient, use a CMV seronegative donor\r\n*** For a CMV seropositive recipient, use a CMV seropositive donor\r\n* In CMV- patients with CMV+ stem-cell donors, primary CMV infection/reactivation develops in about 30%; data from the European Registry shows the following: seropositive patients receiving grafts from CMV+ HLA-identical sibling donors had the same survival as patients grafted from CMV- donors; however, matched unrelated donor (MUD) recipients receiving grafts from CMV+ donors had an improved 5-year survival, an improved event-free survival, and a reduced transplant-related mortality; there was no influence on the relapse incidence; the effects of donor CMV status remained in multivariate analyses; the effect of donor status was different among different disease categories; in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, T-cell depletion abrogated the beneficial effect of donor status, suggesting that the effect is mediated through transfer of donor immunity; these data suggest that donor CMV status influences outcome of unrelated stem cell transplant (SCT)
DONOR: The cytomegalovirus (CMV) status of the pair donor-recipient is frequently employed to select a potential donor; the following guidelines are recommended:\r\n* For a CMV seronegative recipient, use a CMV seronegative donor\r\n* For a CMV seropositive recipient, use a CMV seropositive donor
