Diagnosis and staging of de novo acute GvHD of the GIT (any site except isolated “upper” GIT disease);\r\n* Patients must be classifief as \high risk\ by the combined Minnesota (MN)/Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant (CIBMTR) grading\r\n* Biopsies should be obtained by full endoscopy including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy; however, it is not necessary to have confirmation of GvHD diagnosis before initiating IASA therapy; such is not recommended\r\n* If other diagnoses are excluded, it is not necessary to biopsy all potentially involved sites in the GIT to initiate therapy\r\n* It is possible that other diagnoses may be present as well, and this should not exclude eligibility so long as they are distinct (this statement is generic, but applies especially to various types of infective colitis; that said, concomitant anti-infective therapy must be on-going)\r\n* Although this study is designed for patient with high-risk de novo, acute GvHD of the lower gastrointestinal tract, selected patients with more advanced, even “steroid refractory” acute GvHD may be considered for this study providing they fulfill two criteria: 1) have no history of prior IASA; and 2) are personally approved by the principal investigator (PI), or in his absence, his designee
Prior or on-going therapy:\r\n* No previous systemic (topical allowed) therapy for acute GvHD --except for a maximum (and ideally less) of 48 hours of prior glucocorticoid (GC) therapy, > 0.5 mg/kg/day of MePDSL or equivalent after the onset of acute GvHD\r\n* An exception to the above exists for patients with prior acute GvHD (of any site) who received GC therapy, experienced a complete response (CR), were tapered off GC and recurred >= 15 days later; such are eligible after review by the PI or his designee\r\n* For patients with SR, no prior stipulations – beyond prior IASA – will be specified\r\n* The use of on-going acute GvHD prophylaxis will be continued as above (if in the rare case this is not possible due to toxicity, discussion with, and approval by the study PI is required)\r\n* Moreover, the use of any other IST is allowed if acute GvHD of the GIT develops while the patient is off all IST; IST may be restarted at the discretion of the attending physician after discussion with the PI of this study\r\n* Treatment with oral budesonide is to be started or continued at full dose\r\n* Please consult with the study PI regarding any questions or concerns of study eligibility
Patients may not be receiving any other drugs for the treatment of GvHD or investigational agents, except for a maximum of 48 hours of prior GC therapy, as above (obviously, this requirement is waived for SA – acute GvHD patients; in this case, no requirements are mandated)
