Patients developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic organ transplant; in these cases, the lymphoma is usually of recipient origin; EBV-specific T-cells will be selected from the MSKCC bank expanded from an EBV-seropositive normal donor who is at least matched for 1) 2 HLA antigens and 2) one restricted allele with the EBV lymphoma; if the origin of the lymphoma is unknown, T-cells partially matched with the recipient transplant will be used, since these lymphomas are usually of host origin; using this approach to donor selection, it is expected that the EBV-specific, HLA restricted cytotoxic T-cells expanded from the HLA partially-matched donor would be able to recognize and kill lymphoma cells presenting EBV antigens in the context of an appropriate HLA restricting element; priority will be given to the use of partially matched EBV specific T cells known to be restricted by an HLA allele shared by the lymphoma (or, if known, the patient)
