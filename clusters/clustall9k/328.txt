Patients with NSCLC that harbors an ALK rearrangement, or sensitizing EGFR mutation
Subjects with known ALK translocations which are sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy are excluded; if tested, use of an FDA-approved test is strongly encouraged; subjects with unknown or indeterminate ALK status may be enrolled
Treatment on this protocol may begin as long as the patient has recovered from toxicities of prior therapy at the discretion of the treating physician; patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an EGFR, ALK or ROS-1 alteration must have progressed through at least one prior therapy with appropriate molecularly targeted agents
Must have progressed following treatment with platinum-based combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and patients with an EGFR or ALK/ROS1 genetic aberration must have received appropriately targeted treatment.
Subjects known to be anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-fusion/rearrangement mutation positive must have received an ALK inhibitor.
Subjects with a known EGFR mutation must have received previous treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; and subjects with a known ALK translocation must have received previous treatment with an ALK inhibitor.
NSCLC with known EGFR mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocation (such as EML4-ALK)
ALK-rearrangement confirmed by FDA approved test
Prior therapy with ALK inhibitor other than crizotinib
Patient must have been pre-identified as having a tumor with an ALK or ROS1 positive mutation, translocation, rearrangement or amplification. The qualifying alteration must be assessed and reported by a CLIA-certified laboratory. ALK positivity as assessed by IHC or FISH are allowed.
Patients must have documented ALK positivity at the time of initial crizotinib monotherapy using the Vysis Break-Apart FISH assay (or other Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved diagnostic test); samples are deemed to be FISH-positive if greater than or equal to 15% of scored tumor cells had split ALK 5? and 3? probe signals or had isolated 3? signal; FISH status must be documented on the Onstudy Form and a copy of the pathology report from the Vysis Break-Apart FISH assay (or other FDA-approved diagnostic test) must be submitted
Prior treatment with dalantercept or other agent targeting the ALK1 pathway.
Documented ALK rearrangement based on FDA approved test
Receipt of any other ALK inhibitors in addition to crizotinib
Known EGFR (exon 19 and 21) mutations, ALK translocations, and/or ROS-1 translocations
For NSCLC, an ALK translocation must be detected by FISH in ? 15% of tumor cells.
In patients with diseases other than NSCLC, ALK translocation is not required and overexpression of ALK protein may be considered indicative of a genetic abnormality in ALK.
Patients with EGFR- or ALK-positive disease are not eligible for this study
Patients with an Alk+ relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancy including but not limited to ALK+ ALCL or ALK+ large B cell lymphoma
No known presence of known EGFR or EML4-ALK driver mutations in the tumor
Known sensitizing mutation in the EGFR gene or ALK fusion oncogene
Patients with NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous, or adenosquamous histopathology) must also meet the following criteria: a. Must have disease that is stage IIIB, not curable by surgery or radiotherapy, or stage IV; b. Must have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease; c. EGFR-positive or ALK-positive patients must have received at least one line of EGFR-directed or ALK-directed therapy, respectively; d. Must have received prior taxane therapy.
Chemotherapy naive NSCLC patients; for NSCLC patients with lung adenocarcinoma, tumors must be EGFR and ALK wild-type; if a KRAS mutation is detected, EGFR and ALK testing is not required
Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC that is EGFR Wild-type, ALK-negative rearrangement and ROS1-negative rearrangement
Patients with histological- or cytological-confirmed, advanced unresectable breast, gastric, or non-small cell lung cancer, who have progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard anticancer therapy exists. a. Part C: Only the following subtype of tumors with the molecular/genetic alterations will be enrolled: HER2 positive MBC Advanced NSCLC, harboring EGFR mutations after progression on osimertinib Advanced NSCLC, harboring ALK translocations after treatment with alectinib or at least 2 ALK inhibitors
ALK positive NSCLC patients must either be treatment naive in the advanced setting or have had disease progression on or intolerance to at least 1 previous ALK inhibitor; ROS1 positive NSCLC patients must either be treatment naive in the advanced setting or have had disease progression on or intolerance to at least 1 previous ROS1 inhibitor
After progression on or intolerance to prior ALK or ROS inhibitor therapy:\r\n* A minimum washout period of at least 5 days between the last dose of ALK or ROS tyrosine kinase therapy (TKI) therapy and the first dose of study treatment is required; a shorter washout period may be considered in the event of disease flare, after discussion with the sponsor\r\n* Patients must have recovered from treatment toxicities to =< grade 1 or to their pretreatment levels except for adverse events (AEs) that in the investigator’s judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient
Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB (and is not a candidate for definitive multimodality therapy) or stage IV NSCLC demonstrated ALK-positive or an advanced tumor, other than NSCLC, that carries an ALK genetic alteration (mutation, translocation or amplification) and/or ALK overexpression that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy exists.
The test to confirm ALK-positivity may be performed in archival tumor (obtained at or since the time of diagnosis), or in a newly obtained tumor sample taken prior to the first day of study drug. Results confirming ALK-positive status must be available before initiating treatment with ceritinib.
