Participant has been previously treated with azacitidine (any formulation), decitabine, or any other hypomethylating agent.
Subject has been previously treated with azacitidine (any formulation), decitabine, or any other hypomethylating agent.

Patients may have received up to 3 prior cycles of hypomethylator therapy (i.e. decitabine or azacitidine) prior to enrollment and may have received supportive care measures (growth factors, erythropoietin stimulating agents, transfusion, etc)
Patients must have completed at least 4 cycles of hypomethylating agent therapy (e.g azacitidine or decitabine) with failure to achieve at least a partial response, or with the presence of ongoing cytopenias per IWG (platelet count < 100x10^9/L, hemoglobin <11g/L or ANC <1x10^9/L). Patients with progressive disease on HMA-therapy prior to this time point are also eligible at the time of documented progression. Therapy with decitabine analogs (i.e. SGI-110) will be considered as decitabine for the purposes of this study.
Patients receiving concomitant treatment with other anti-neoplastic agents, with the exception of hydroxyurea; however, prior treatment with DNMTi therapy (i.e., decitabine or azacitidine) for MDS or other antecedent hematologic malignancy is allowed\r\n* NOTE: if the patient has been initiated on the protocol defined regimen (i.e. decitabine without a FLT3 inhibitor) before the FLT3 mutation status was known, the patient may be registered on the protocol and start midostaurin on day 11
Prior therapy with decitabine or azacitidine
Patients must be 28 days from the end of the last induction course or at least 14 days from completion of previous methyltransferase inhibitor therapy (azacitidine or decitabine) at the time of registration
Patient must have undergone =< 2 cycles of prior hypomethylating agent (decitabine or azacitidine)
No response, progression, or relapse (according to 2006 International Working Group [IWG] criteria) following at least 4 cycles of either azacitidine or decitabine, or following at least 2 cycles of SGI-110, which were completed within the last 2 years - AND/OR - intolerance to azacitidine or decitabine, or SGI-110 defined as drug-related >= grade 3 hepatic or renal toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation during the preceding 2 years
At least one prior HMTA treatment with either azacitidine or decitabine and subsequent loss of response to HMTA, progression while on HMTA, or no response to HMTA, defined as failure to achieve at least hematologic improvement (HI) after 4 cycles of treatment
One course of hypomethylating agent therapy (i.e.; up to 7 doses of azacitidine or 3-5 days of decitabine) within 30 days prior to enrollment (Day 1)
Eligible for therapy with either decitabine or azacitidine
Eligible for therapy with azacitidine.
Patients with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with >= 10% bone marrow blasts with no response or progression of disease after at least 4 cycles of a hypomethylating agent (5-azacytidine or decitabine)
Previous therapy with cytotoxic agents for AML; persons with previous treatments for myelodysplasia/myeloproliferation such as hydroxyurea, interferon, hypomethylating agents (5-azacitidine or decitabine), lenalidomide, or Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) inhibitors may participate but must have > 1 week off therapy prior to enrollment
Subjects with any prior exposure to the hypomethylating agents (5-azacitadine or decitabine) are excluded
For Cohort 3 subjects, prior treatment with hypomethylating agents (eg, azacitidine, decitabine)
Previous treatment with azacitidine (any formulation), decitabine, any other hypomethylating agent.
Patients may have received azacitidine, decitabine, or lenalidomide but no “cytotoxic therapy” such as ara-C or anthracyclines; data suggest that failure to respond to azacitidine reduces probability of response to 3+7; hence in the interest of having a relatively homogeneous population, while patients who have received and failed azacitidine or decitabine will be eligible for this study, they will be analyzed separately from patients who have not received these drugs
Use of any of the following after transplantation and prior to starting oral Azacitidine:
Azacitidine, decitabine or other demethylating agents
Previous treatment with azacitidine or decitabine
Prior therapy with decitabine or azacitidine
Patients who were treated with 5'-azacitidine without response prior to transplant would be eligible to participate on this protocol
Adequate course of treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent (azacitidine for injection or decitabine) as the last therapeutic intervention for MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES) prior to beginning screening for this study. Adequate is defined as:
having received at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with azacitidine for injection, or
having received at least 4 consecutive 6-week treatment cycles with decitabine (3-day regimen) or at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with decitabine (5-day regimen), or
having demonstrated inability to tolerate treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent because of unacceptable drug-related toxicity after at least 3 months of attempted treatment: Three 28-day cycles of azacitidine for injection or decitabine 5-day regimen; two 42-day cycles of decitabine 3-day regimen.
Documented disease progression or stable disease as best response to treatment (or attempted treatment) with azacitidine for injection or decitabine. Those achieving an objective response to treatment regimen with an injectable Hypomethylating agent (HMA) are excluded from participation in this study. Definitions of disease progression are modified from IWG (INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP) 2006 criteria and include:
Have the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) - azacitidine for injection or decitabine) not more than 16 weeks prior to screening for this study (date of informed consent signature).
No less than 3 weeks between the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) - azacitidine for injection or decitabine) and the planned date of first dose of IP (IINVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT).
Agree to practice true abstinence2 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to the use of highly effective methods of contraception from 28 days prior to starting azacitidine, and must agree to continue using such precautions while taking azacitidine (including dose interruptions) and for up to 90 days after the last dose of azacitidine. Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician
Prior exposure to the investigational oral formulation of decitabine, or other oral azacitidine derivative at any time in the subject's prior history
Prior treatment with a hypomethylating agent (including but not limited to azacitidine or decitabine), unless last treatment with hypomethylating agent was > 3 months prior to start of protocol treatment OR has received =< 2 cycles of hypomethylating agent without disease progression during those =< 2 cycles and last dose was not within 14 days of first protocol treatment
Prior exposure to azacitidine, decitabine or investigational hypomethylating agent
For International Prognostic Staging System (IPSS) high-risk or intermediate-2 MDS, participants must be intolerant of hypomethylating agents or not have responded to 4 treatment cycles of decitabine or 6 treatment cycles of azacitidine, or must have progressed at any point after initiation of a hypomethylating agent.
In the Dose Expansion Segment, which includes the 10-day regimen, subjects who have received 2 complete full dose cycles or more of a hypomethylating agent (HMA) decitabine or azacitidine (except for intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS subjects (including CMML) relapsed or refractory to prior HMA treatment).
