Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor in which case >= 50,000/ml are allowed)
Adequate baseline platelet and neutrophil levels must be present, unless there is clear evidence of extensive bone marrow involvement with tumor infiltration; extensive bone marrow involvement is defined as:\r\n* Bone marrow lymphocytes >= 30%
Minimum absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 cells/ul and minimum platelet count (without transfusion) of 20,000/mm^3; values below these levels may be accepted at the discretion of the PI, if thought to be due to bone marrow involvement by malignancy

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.5 unless cytopenias are related to bone marrow involvement with disease
Hemoglobin >= 7 g/dl unless cytopenias are related to bone marrow involvement with disease
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.5 x 10^9/L, unless due to bone marrow involvement with lymphoma
All patients must have bone marrow involvement of their tumor, with documented blast percentage of > 5%.
Lymphoma participants without bone marrow involvement must have: \r\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,000/µL, and\r\n* Platelet count > 50,000/mm^3 (without transfusion support)\r\n** Note: these criteria are waived for participants with leukemia or lymphoma participants with bone marrow involvement

If patient has extensive bone marrow involvement, minimum ANC and platelet levels are not required.
Absolute neutrophil count ?1,000/µL (unless due to documented leukemic involvement of the bone marrow at the time of study entry)

Absolute neutrophil count >= 1000 cells/mm^3 (1.0 x 10^9/L), unless they have significant bone marrow involvement of their malignancy confirmed on biopsy, completed within 2 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy; growth factor allowed to achieve
Adequate bone marrow reserve: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to (>=) 1000 per cubic millimeter (/mm^3), platelet count >=75,000/ mm^3 (>=50,000 per micro liter (/mcL) for participants with bone marrow involvement), and hemoglobin >=8 gram per deciliter (g/dL) (red blood cell [RBC] transfusion allowed >=14 days before assessment).
