Have a diagnosis of metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) • Up to 1-2 prior lines of chemotherapy
Histopathological diagnosis of metastatic or inoperable locally advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that meets the following criteria:\r\n* Triple negative is generally defined as estrogen receptor (ER) < 1%, progesterone receptor (PR) < 1%, and HER2 negative according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines by local testing according to institutional standards\r\n** Note: for tumors with equivocal interpretation of receptor status (e.g., ER/PR >= 1% “weak” or “faint” staining), the principal investigator will have final determination of triple-negative status; for tumors with discrepant receptor results between 2 or more biopsies (including metastatic and/or early stage biopsies), the principal investigator will have final determination of triple negative status, but in general the most recent biopsy can be used for eligibility purposes; if receptor testing is not available on a metastatic biopsy, the primary tumor test result is acceptable\r\n* Metastatic or inoperable locally advanced disease is defined as either: histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer by biopsy; or locally advanced breast cancer that, in the opinion of the treating physician, is not amenable to curative intent surgical resection; or, radiological or clinical evidence suggestive and supportive of metastatic disease without a documented metastatic biopsy, provided the patient has a prior diagnosis of TNBC that otherwise meets the eligibility criteria\r\n* Ductal, lobular, mixed, or metaplastic histology
