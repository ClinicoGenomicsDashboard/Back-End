Cohort Expansion: One or more tumors measurable on CT/MRI scan per RECIST v 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009; Appendix C).
Measurable disease by CT or MRI
Uneqivocal evidence of a first tumor recurrence or progression on the initial treatment regimen (prior to enrollment on this study), consisting of surgical intervention (biopsy and/or resection), radiation, and temozolomide chemotherapy, as assessed by MRI or CT scan of the brain with or without contrast within 14 days prior to the start of SL-701. If receiving corticosteroids, the dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. Patients unable to undergo MRI because of non-compatible devices can be enrolled, provided CT scans are obtained and are of sufficient quality. For each patient, the same imaging technique should be performed throughout the study, for purposes of assessing tumor response or PD.
No evidence of hemorrhage on the baseline MRI or CT scan other than those that are Grade ? 1 and either post-operative or stable on at least two consecutive scans.
For patients who have undergone or will undergo stereotactic biopsy of recurrent or progressive tumor, a post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not required, provided that the pre-biopsy MRI is within 21 days of registration; if the preoperative scan is more than 21 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated; if the steroid dose is increased more than 50% between the date of biopsy and registration, a new baseline MRI is required on a stable or decreasing steroid dosage for at least 3 days even if the previous MRI was within 21 days of registration
For patients who have undergone or will undergo open resection of recurrent or progressive tumor, residual disease following resection is not mandated for eligibility into the study; to best assess the extent of residual disease post-resection, a MRI scan should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-resection period and within 21 days prior to registration; if the 96-hour scan is more than 21 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated; if the steroid dose is increased more than 50% between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI is required on a stable or decreasing steroid dosage for at least 3 days
Evidence of tumor progression by MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan following radiation therapy or following the most recent anti-tumor therapy; note: patients who have had surgical treatment at recurrence are eligible if they had a resection with measurable or non-measurable residual disease on postoperative imaging or if there is imaging evidence of disease progression as compared to the first postoperative scan
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline by CT, MRI or plain X-ray and is suitable for repeated assessment. Estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks.
Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study; to best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, an MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate postoperative period or at least 4 weeks postoperatively, within 14 days prior to registration; if the \within 96-hour of surgery\ scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated
Evidence of metastatic disease on bone scan or MRI/computed tomography (CT)
Pelvic MRI or CT (MRI preferred) evidence of radiographic T3, T4 or N1 disease
Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage on baseline MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan (except for grade 1 hemorrhage that has been stable for at least 3 months)
Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:\r\n* They are > 2 weeks from surgery\r\n* They have recovered from the effects of surgery\r\n* Evaluable or measurable disease following resection of recurrent tumor is mandated for eligibility into the study\r\n* To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, an enhanced CT/MRI should be done no later than 96 hours after surgery or it will need to be done 4-6 weeks post-operatively; if the 96 hour scan is more than 2 weeks from registration, the scan needs to be repeated
A baseline scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days otherwise a new baseline MR/CT is required; the same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement
Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI (or CT for patients who cannot tolerate MRI) in comparison to a prior scan; the same type of scan, i.e., MRI (or CT for patients who cannot undergo MRI) must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement
Residual disease of recurrent glioblastoma is not mandated for eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a post-operative MRI scan must be performed prior to registration and is recommended to be within 96 hours post-surgery (although 24-48 hours would be optimum). Note: Patients who did have surgery with a post-operative contrast-enhanced scan falling outside the 5-week window prior to registration, must have a repeat MRI scan within 14 days prior to registration.
Implanted metal or metal devices that make a MRI scan prohibitive, history of claustrophobia or other condition that would make a MRI scan prohibitive
MRI (contrast is not required but strongly recommended) of the involved spine within 4 weeks prior to registration to determine the extent of the spine involvement; an MRI is required as it is superior to a CT scan in delineating the spinal cord as well as identifying an epidural or paraspinal soft tissue component; note: if an MRI was done as a screening imaging study for eligibility, the MRI can be used as the required MRI for treatment planning

Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) avid disease on baseline scan For enrollment in part 2, patients must meet all of the following:
Patients must have pathologic diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), by either histologic biopsy, or cytologic evidence; highly suspicious cytology (i.e. abnormal cells suspicious for malignancy) is acceptable, in the setting of a strongly positive computed tomography (CT)/positron emission tomography (PET) (standardized uptake value [SUV] > 5.0)
Systemic staging including computed tomography (CT) that covers the chest, liver and adrenal glands or a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is required and must be negative for metastatic spread; if a patient is unable to tolerate MRI or has a contraindication to MRI, a head CT scan with and without contrast is acceptable
There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy to start of device treatment; when the interval is less than 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy, the histological confirmation of progression must be unequivocal per Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria; the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scan, perfusion imaging, and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy to differentiate between true early progression and pseudoprogression prior to biopsy or resection of probable recurrent tumor is per standard of care

No evidence of relapsed or residual malignancy within 30 days of trial entry; all patients must undergo appropriate staging for their malignancy (i.e. bone marrow aspiration for the leukemias and positron emission tomography [PET]-computed tomography [CT] scanning for the lymphomas); evidence of a persistent cytogenetic abnormality will constitute evidence of residual or relapsed disease in the leukemias, where present; individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are eligible if there is no more than 20% residual leukemia in the bone marrow at the time of study entry
NHL\r\n* No clinical evidence of disease or disease-related symptoms\r\n* Typically fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymphomas: a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is positron emission tomography (PET) negative\r\n* Variably FDG-avid lymphoma/FDG avidity unknown: all lymph nodes normal size by computed tomography (CT)\r\n* Spleen and liver non-palpable and without nodules\r\n* If pretreatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, repeat bone marrow biopsy must be negative; if morphologically indeterminate, immunohistochemistry should be negative
