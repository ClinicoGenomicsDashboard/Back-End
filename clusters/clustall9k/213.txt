Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Combined Oral Contraceptive or Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches . This is an all-inclusive list of those methods that meet the following GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Females A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative Urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: • Non-reproductive potential defined as: Pre-menopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as: 60 years old; Twelve(12) months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, > 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or medical suppression of the menstrual cycle (e.g. leuprolide treatment) in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. • Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) (As mentioned in study protocol) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until 3 months after the last dose of study medication.
