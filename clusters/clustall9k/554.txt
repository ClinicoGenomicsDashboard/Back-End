Receiving prophylactic use of hematopoietic colony stimulating factors
Allergy to both penicillin & sulfa or suspected hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), dimethyl sulfoxide, fetal bovine serum, trypsin, yeast, glycerol or other component of the therapy options
Requirement for routine use of hematopoietic growth factors (including granulocyte colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, or interleukin-11) or platelet transfusions to maintain absolute neutrophil counts or platelets counts above the required thresholds for study entry
Screening ANC should be independent of granulocyte-and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (G-CSF and GM-CSF) support for at least 1 week and of pegylated G-CSF for at least 2 weeks
Screening ANC should be independent of granulocyte-and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (G-CSF and GM-CSF) support for at least 1 week and of pegylated G-CSF for at least 2 weeks
Condition (such as transfusion dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia), therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results, or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study treatment. Patients who received colony stimulating factors (eg, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] or recombinant erythropoietin) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment are not eligible
Received transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or administration of colony stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, recombinant erythropoietin) within 14 days prior to the first dose of GSK3359609.
Subjects must have fully recovered from the toxic effects of any prior therapy; at least 3 weeks should have elapsed since the last dose of chemotherapy (6 weeks in the case of nitrosourea containing therapy); subjects must have recovered from previous colony-stimulating factor therapy and have been off colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], interleukin [IL]-11) for more than 10 days and off erythropoietin for 30 days
Current systemic treatment for AML, with the exception of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) must have been discontinued at least 7 days prior to entry into the study; in addition:\r\n* At least 4 weeks before day 1 for interleukin (IL)-11 (oprelvekin)\r\n* At least 8 weeks before day 1 for antithymocyte/antilymphocyte globulin
Patients with any contraindication or known hypersensitivity to receiving sargramostatin (recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor [rhuGM-CSF]) or other yeast based products
DONOR: Willing to receive Triplex vaccination, a minimum of 14 days prior to the start of granulocyte stimulating factor (GSF) mobilization
Hemoglobin > 8.0 g/dL without transfusion or growth factor support for at least 7 days prior to screening (with the exception of pegylated granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF] and darbopoietin, which require at least 14 days of abstinence prior to screening)
Subject is receiving concurrent chemotherapy or biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment; subject is receiving bone marrow stimulatory factors (e.g., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]); Note: Concurrent use of hormones for noncancer-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes) is acceptable
Treatment with marrow stimulating agents (e.g. granulocyte colony stimulating factor [GCSF]) within 3 weeks of baseline scan
No concurrent use of erythroid stimulating agents, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is allowed during study except in cases of febrile neutropenia where G-CSF can be used for short term; growth factors must be stopped 14 days prior to study
Any hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., filgrastim [granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF], sargramostim [granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF]) within 14 days prior to receiving study treatment
Treatment with granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte (G-CSF) within 4 weeks prior to first PET scan; patients should avoid treatment with these agents between the baseline and 6-12 treatment week imaging sessions
Have received treatment with agents specifically targeting colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) or CSF-1R, including imatinib, nilotinib, and sunitinib.
