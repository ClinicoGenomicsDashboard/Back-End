History of prior >= G 3 hypersensitivity (HSR) or any toxicity to trastuzumab or pertuzumab that warranted permanent cessation of this agent
Prior treatment with pertuzumab, Lapatinib, and/or Trastuzumab emtansine is allowed; however, the last treatment for MBC must not include Trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab.
Last treatment for metastatic disease including Trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab
Prior treatment with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib or trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting is allowed but not required\r\n* Lapatininb has to be discontinued > 21 days before the initiation of the T+P study treatments; prior lapatinib in combination with hormonal therapy for treatment of MBC is allowed but not required as long as the other eligibility criteria are met
Participants must have received prior therapy with the following agents in any combination, and in setting (i.e., neoadjuvant, adjuvant, metastatic, etc.); these therapies do not need to be the most recent line of therapy\r\n* Trastuzumab\r\n* Pertuzumab\r\n* Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)
Patients must continue HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy dosing per standard of care through the entire study period (one year)\r\n* HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy is defined as either trastuzumab monotherapy, or trastuzumab and pertuzumab combination therapy administered per standard of care
Prior therapy - prior trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DMI) are allowed; there is no limit on the number of prior lines of therapy
Participants must have received at least 1 line of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic breast cancer and/or relapse/progressed while on or within 6 months of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant trastuzumab/pertuzumab; prior pertuzumab is allowed for Cohort B but not Cohort A
Patients must have progressed on, or be intolerant to pertuzumab in the LABC/MBC setting or had disease recurrence within 12 months of pertuzumab treatment in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.
Patients must have been previously treated with trastuzumab in any setting (which may have been previously administered with or without pertuzumab)
Must have included trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine. Subjects starting initial systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer prior to June 2012 are not required to have had pertuzumab
Receipt of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or ado-trastuzumab emtansine within 4 weeks of scheduled dosing day 1.
No known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab or pertuzumab
Prior systemic cancer-directed treatments or investigational modalities =< 5 half lives or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter, prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from grade 2 or higher side effects of such therapy (except alopecia); an exception to this would be in patients receiving trastuzumab or pertuzumab immediately prior to trial enrollment, for whom the initial doses of trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab on study can be given within a time frame consistent with clinical guidelines and investigator discretion
Known allergic reaction to neratinib, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, paclitaxel, or any of their components
Prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, either alone or in combination, is required.
Any number of prior chemotherapies or biological therapies are allowed, patients are required to have prior treatment with pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine with the exceptions listed below: \r\n* Metastatic patients who have not received prior pertuzumab are eligible if: heavily pretreated prior to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of pertuzumab (08-June-2012) for first line treatment of HER2+ MBC\r\n* Metastatic patients who have not received ado-trastuzumab emtansine are eligible if: heavily pretreated prior to FDA approval of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (22-Feb-2013) for the treatment of patients with HER2+ MBC who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination
No limit to prior therapies with last anti-cancer treatment >= 2 weeks from initiation of WBRT; please note: there is no washout period required for trastuzumab and pertuzumab
Continuation of trastuzumab and pertuzumab are allowed for those patients already on trastuzumab and pertuzumab therapy
Use of chemotherapy, trastuzumab, or pertuzumab within the past 3 weeks
