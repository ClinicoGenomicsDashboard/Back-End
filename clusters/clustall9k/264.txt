At least moderate dyspnea defined by a BDI score of 6 or less in the self-administered computerized versions of the baseline and transition dyspnea indexes (SAC-BDI/TDI); (this cutoff score is close to the score of 5.7 used to define \moderate dyspnea\ in the publication that validated the instrument and is selected by attending physicians in the pulmonary service as a good indication of \ moderate dyspnea\ in clinical practice; a typical person with BDI of 6, for example, would be a 52 year old woman who has to pause when walking because of dyspnea and/or has eliminated doing an activity because of dyspnea)
