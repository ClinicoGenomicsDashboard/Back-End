Baseline prolongation of QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval, i.e., defined as an average QTc interval > 450 msec calculated using the Fridericia formula for QT correction; long QT syndrome; or the required use of concomitant medication that may cause torsade de pointes
Corrected QT interval (QTc) >470 msec (as calculated by Fridericia correction formula) at study entry or congenital long QT syndrome.
History of congenital long QT syndrome or mean corrected QTc interval > 450 msec at baseline
History of congenital long QT syndrome or QTc > 470 msec
Have Fridericia-corrected QT interval > 470 milliseconds (msec) (female) or > 450 msec (male), or history of congenital long QT syndrome
Corrected QT (QTc) interval ? 450 msec at baseline or history of congenital long QT syndrome or uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities. (Patients with well controlled atrial fibrillation are exempt from this criteria.)
Patients must have corrected QT (QTC) interval =< 480 msec on electrocardiogram (EKG) at baseline; patient with congenital long QT syndrome are not eligible
Subjects with a high probability of Long QT Syndrome or QTc interval prolongation of more than or equal to 501 msec on at least two separate ECGs, following correction of any electrolyte imbalance.
Any of the following cardiac abnormalities or history:\r\n* Clinically significant abnormal 12-lead electrocardiograph (ECG), QT interval corrected using Fridericia's method (QTcF) > 450 msec\r\n* Inability to measure QT interval on ECG\r\n* Personal or family history of long QT syndrome\r\n* Implantable pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator\r\n* Resting bradycardia < 55 beats/min
Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc), calculated using Fridericia’s formula, > 470 msec obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs), family or personal history of long or short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation or torsade de pointes within 12 months of the patient entering in the study
Corrected QT interval (QTc) > 470 msec (as calculated by Fridericia correction formula) at study entry or congenital long QT syndrome
Patients with history of long QT syndrome, uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities, or corrected QT (QTc) > 500 msec
