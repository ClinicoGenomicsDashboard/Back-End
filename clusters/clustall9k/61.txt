For patients requiring anti-coagulation with vitamin K antagonists, therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site. Exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR. Consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate. If clinically indicated, prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency.
Participants receiving oral warfarin are not eligible for this study (unless warfarin is discontinued at least 7 days prior to commencement of treatment and for the duration of the study, or oral warfarin is converted to LMWH, where local clinical opinion considers this an acceptable option).
