Subject has a history of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) including polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Current acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia
Myeloproliferative disorders to be included:\r\n* Idiopathic myelofibrosis\r\n* Polycythemia vera\r\n* Essential thrombocythemia\r\n* Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia\r\n* Chronic neutrophilic leukemia\r\n* Chronic eosinophilic leukemia\r\n* Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\r\n* Hypereosinophilic syndrome\r\n* Systemic mastocytosis
For patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, patient’s disease must have evidence of never responded to or progressed after receiving a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (e.g. imatinib mesylate)
Patients with accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia may have =< 10% blasts in the peripheral smear or bone marrow at study entry
Lymphoblastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) All subjects with evidence of CNS leukemia must be treated and be in CNS CR to be eligible for trial.
Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in myeloid blasts crisis
Patients must have morphologically confirmed newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with blood or bone marrow disease; patients with only extramedullary disease in the absence of bone marrow or blood involvement are not eligible; note: this protocol uses World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for AML; patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, French-American-British [FAB], M3) or blastic transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are not eligible; patients with known core binding factor (CBF) or fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) related leukemias are eligible for this study, but should preferentially be placed on National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored protocols specific for these subtypes, if available
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in 1st or subsequent remission
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Subjects with any of the following will NOT be eligible for study:\r\n* Bone marrow involvement\r\n* Active myelogenous leukemia, or history of myelogenous leukemia\r\n* Pregnancy
Be diagnosed with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Re-induction of acute myelogenous or lymphocytic leukemia after primary relapse
Chronic Myelogenous leukemia
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
