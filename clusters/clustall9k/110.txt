No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance due to pulmonary insufficiency, and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air
Pulse oximetry > 94% on room air if there is clinical indication for determination (e.g. dyspnea at rest)
Pulse oximetry > 94% on room air if there is clinical indication for determination (e.g. dyspnea at rest)
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry > 94% if there is clinical indication or determination; pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are not required
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a resting pulse oximetry reading > 94% on room air if there is clinical indication for determination
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry > 94% at sea level if there is clinical indication for determination
For children who are unable to cooperate for PFTs, the criteria are: no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry reading of > 92% on room air
Patients with a history of pulmonary dysfunction must have no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance due to pulmonary insufficiency, and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air unless current dysfunction is due to the lymphoma in which case the patient is eligible
Pulse oximetry > 94% on room air if there is clinical indication for determination (e.g. dyspnea at rest)
Patients must have normal pulmonary function testing for age based on pulse oximetry
Pulse oximetry > 93% on room air and no evidence of dyspnea at rest
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STRATUM C: Pulse oximetry > 93% on room air and no evidence of dyspnea at rest
Pulse oximetry >= 94% if there is clinical indication for determination
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry > 94%
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry > 94%
Adequate pulmonary function as defined as: no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry > 94% if there is clinical indication for determination
No evidence of dyspnea at rest and pulse oximetry > 94%
For children who are unable to perform pulmonary function tests but have no evidence of dyspnea at rest nor exercise intolerance nor abnormal chest X-ray (CXR), a pulse oximetry > 94% on room air is acceptable
Patients must have no evidence of dyspnea at rest and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must have no evidence of dyspnea at rest and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air
Pulse oximetry > 94% if there is clinical indication for determination
For children who are uncooperative for pulmonary function tests and have no evidence of dyspnea at rest or exercise intolerance, pulse oximetry > 94% on room air is considered acceptable, with a normal chest X-ray
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no history of exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry > 94%
Adequate pulmonary function defined as:\r\n* No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, no chronic oxygen requirement, and room air pulse oximetry > 94% if there is a clinical indication for pulse oximetry; normal pulmonary function tests in patients who are capable of cooperating with testing (including diffusion capacity of the lung of carbon monoxide [DLCO]) are required if there is a clinical indication for determination; for patients who do not have respiratory symptoms, full pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are NOT required
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance due to pulmonary insufficiency, and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air
No evidence of dyspnea at rest and a pulse oximetry > 94% if there is clinical indication for determination
Patients must not have any evidence of dyspnea at rest, exercise intolerance, and must have a pulse oximetry > 94% at sea level
A pulse oximetry ? 94% at sea level (? 90% at altitude ? 5000 feet) if there is clinical indication for determination.
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry > 94% in room air, if there is clinical indication for determination
