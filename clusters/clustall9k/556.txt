Patients already treated for their brain metastasis, surgery or radiation therapy, and have had stable disease for more than two month and NOT requiring steroids may however be included in this study.

Subjects with known or suspected brain metastasis, or brain as the only site of disease are excluded with the following exceptions\r\n* Subjects with controlled brain metastasis (no radiographic progression at least 4 weeks following radiation and/or surgical treatment, off steroids for at least 4 weeks, and have no new or progressing neurological signs or symptoms) will be allowed\r\n* Subjects with a history of prior malignancy with the exception of carcinoma in situ of the cervix or other malignancy diagnosed > 2 years ago that has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of disease for the last >= 2 years and that is deemed by the investigator to be at a low risk of recurrence
Presence of central nervous system metastasis (including active brain metastasis); active brain metastasis would be defined as untreated brain metastases; if the brain metastases have received prior treatment (usually either with surgery or radiation), they are no longer active
Active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain metastasis) at the time of randomization. Participants with a history of a CNS metastasis previously treated with curative intent (for example, stereotactic radiation or surgery) that have not progressed on follow-up imaging, have been asymptomatic for at least 60 days and are not receiving systemic corticosteroids and or/anticonvulsants, are eligible. Participants with signs or symptoms of neurological compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before randomization to rule out brain metastasis.
Documented extracranial metastasis
If the patient has brain metastasis, they must have been stable (treated and/or asymptomatic) and the patient must have been off steroids for at least 2 weeks
Evidence of active brain metastasis including leptomeningeal involvement\r\n* CNS metastasis controlled by prior surgery and/or radiotherapy is allowed; NOTE: to be considered controlled, there must be at least 4 weeks of no clinical symptoms or evidence of progression prior to study entry and corticosteroid therapy must have been discontinued
presence of a space occupying lesion in the brain including previously treated brain metastasis(es) or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor,
Patients must not have hemoptysis, squamous histology, brain metastasis
Patients with active brain metastases. Patients with prior history of brain metastasis who have undergone local therapy (i.e. metastatectomy and/or radiation) and show no evidence of local recurrence or progression over the past 6 months are eligible
Presence of life-limiting extra-hepatic metastasis that requires a systemic treatment within 3 months; patients with extra-hepatic metastasis that can be controlled with a loco-regional treatment are eligible
Patients with measurable brain metastasis outside a 5-mm margin around either hippocampus
Patients with brain metastasis that are unstable (i.e. presenting with neurologic symptoms that progress or require increasing doses of steroids within a 4-week period) or are untreated (i.e. not radiated) should be excluded
Patients with known intraparenchymal brain metastasis at study entry are excluded due to poor CNS penetration of SF1126.
Palliative radiation for treatment of painful bone metastasis, control of hemoptysis or treatment of small asymptomatic brain metastasis that become symptomatic during on protocol treatment is allowed; protocol treatment will be delayed until recovery from radiation at the discretion of the treating physician
Symptomatic brain metastasis or asymptomatic brain metastasis that are 1 cm or greater in size; patients with asymptomatic sub-centimeter brain metastasis are eligible
Bilirubin > 3 x ULN which cannot be attributed to MCC metastasis
Patients with any history of brain or bone metastasis or who have developed progressive disease on first line 5-FU based therapy
Has active brain metastasis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis; patients with adequately treated brain metastases are eligible if they meet certain criteria
Patients must have no clinical evidence of active brain metastasis. Patients with a history of brain metastases must meet all of the following criteria:
Patients with more than a single brain metastasis ( >1 cm)
Patients may have a history of brain metastasis provided certain protocol criteria are met
Participant with a brain metastasis with symptoms or requiring treatment.
Active brain metastasis or treatment for brain metastasis within 1 month of scheduled dosing day 1. a. Dose of corticosteroid, if any, for brain metastasis must be tolerated in terms of glucose tolerance ? Grade 2 (symptomatic; dietary modification or oral agent indicated) and hyperglycemia ? Grade 2 (fasting glucose value >160 - 250 mg/dL [> 8.9
Recurrent and/or metastatic resectable colorectal cancer, including disease within the abdomen and pelvis with no evidence of extra-abdominal metastases; intra-abdominal disease includes: isolated hepatic metastasis/metastases (see next inclusion criteria point), isolated peritoneal metastasis, or a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic metastasis
Symptomatic brain metastasis. Patients previously treated or untreated for these conditions that are asymptomatic in the absence of corticosteroid and anti-epileptic therapy are allowed to enroll
Patients with brain metastasis treated or untreated, or other CNS disease
Subjects with brain metastasis or central nervous system (CNS) disease are considered eligible if the subject has not received radiation therapy for brain metastasis within 2 weeks of enrollment and has been on a stable dose of steroids for 2 or more weeks
Brain metastasis are excluded unless
Radiologic evidence of new and/or progressive brain metastasis (>= 10 mm in longest dimension) by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain
Subjects with known or suspected brain metastasis unless previously treated and without evidence of progression
