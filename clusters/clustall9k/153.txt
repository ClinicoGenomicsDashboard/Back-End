Must be ? 18 years of age. Due to increased risk of sepsis in patients >80 years old, candidate patients in this age group should be thoroughly evaluated prior to study randomization to ensure they are fit to receive chemotherapy. In addition to all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed, clinical judgment should be used regarding patients' susceptibility to infection (including but not limited to presence of ascites or diabetes mellitus increasing risk of infection). Furthermore, the expected stability of their performance status while receiving repeat weekly chemotherapy cycles should be given special attention. Patients in this age group should not be randomized on the study should there be any hesitation on any of these considerations.
