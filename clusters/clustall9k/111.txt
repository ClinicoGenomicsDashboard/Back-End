Creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 15 mL/minute within 7 days prior to randomization, either measured or calculated using a standard formula (eg, Cockcroft and Gault)
Serum Creatinine Clearance(CrCl) ? 30 mL/min, either measured or calculated using a standard formula (e.g. Cockcroft and Gault)
Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ? 15 mL/min within 21 days prior to randomization. Calculation should be based on standard formula such as the Cockcroft and Gault: [(140 - Age) x Mass (kg) / (72 x Creatinine mg/dL)]; multiply result by 0.85 if female.
Serum creatinine ? 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ? 40 mL/min (measured using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)
Pemetrexed/cisplatin therapy; note: patients who will receive pemetrexed/cisplatin therapy must meet all eligibility criteria below:\r\n* Patients assigned to pemetrexed/cisplatin therapy must NOT have squamous cell histology\r\n* Calculated creatinine clearance must be obtained within 2 weeks of registration and calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) must be >= 45mL/min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula, or the measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the appropriate radiolabeled method (51-CrEDTA or Tc99m-DTPA) must be used to calculate CrCl
Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ? 50 ml/minute (using Cockcroft and Gault's formula; see APPENDIX 2).
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 50 mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)
