PHASE I PATIENTS:
Patients must be >= 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a phase 0 study (also referred to as an “early phase I study” or “pre-phase I study” where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the coordinating center PI’s discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities
Prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody (mAbs), and/or mAb-derived therapies is allowed provided that at least 6 weeks (Phase 1a) or 3 weeks (Phase 1b) have elapsed between the last dose and the proposed Cycle 1, Day 1, with the exceptions as specified in protocol Dose-Exploration/Expansion Cohorts in Phase 1b:
Life expectancy of > 3 months for the run in phase and > 6 months for the randomized phase
Corticosteroids initiated at the time of tumor diagnosis or recurrence for treatment of nerve compression or other symptoms is permitted during this phase of the trial, but will not be permitted during the immunotherapy phase, with the exception of a self-limited course of steroids

PHASE 1 (DEVELOPMENT OF NARRATIVE MESSAGES)
PHASE 2 (RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL [RCT] GROUP)
Phase 2: In Phase 2, clinician participants will be the oncology clinician of record (i.e., oncologist, nurse practitioner) of the first five patients enrolled in the intervention group of the randomized trial
Phase 2: The same four groups of stakeholders from Phase 1 will become involved as research collaborators/consultants for Phase 2 of the study and will not be considered study participants (i.e., will not be registered with Quality Assurance Office for Clinical Trials [QACT])
MONITORING PHASE:
Monitoring phase:
RANDOMIZATION PHASE:
Randomization phase:
At least 3 months into the maintenance phase, with at least 6 months left of\n             maintenance therapy
EVALUATION PHASE
Participants must not be eligible only for phase I trial
Phase I: Self-identify as Hispanic/Latino
PHASE I: MGUH patients presenting for well visits, and patients' parents
Women who are premenopausal, are on a stable contraceptive regimen, and are planning to continue the same regimen through surgery are eligible to participate; for women who are on hormonal contraception regimens that have a placebo phase, the following should be recorded regarding the day of baseline core biopsy and the day of surgery: the agent, whether they are in active or placebo phase, the day of the phase (e.g. day 13 of 21-day active phase or day 4 of 7-day placebo phase); this information will have to be back-calculated for the day of core biopsy, but best attempt should be made
RPFNA performed within 6 months of the study entry visit and in the follicular portion (day 1-10) of the menstrual cycle; note that day 1 is defined as the first day of bleeding; for non-menstruating women, RPFNA during the follicular phase must be confirmed by hormone levels drawn on the day of RPFNA; either clinical laboratory results are sent to protocol chair for assessment of menstrual cycle phase; or an additional frozen serum aliquot is sent to University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) for assay of hormone levels and phase confirmation; confirmation of follicular phase will be included in the eligibility report for the potential subject
