Availability of a recent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block from a de novo tumor biopsy during screening (biopsied tumor lesion should not be a RECIST target lesion). Alternatively, a recently obtained archival FFPE tumor tissue block (not cut slides) from a primary or metastatic tumor resection or biopsy can be provided if the following criteria are met: 1) the biopsy or resection was performed within 1 year of enrollment AND 2) the patient has not received any intervening systemic anti-cancer treatment from the time the tissue was obtained and enrollment onto the current study. If an FFPE tissue block cannot be provided as per documented regulations,, 15 unstained slides (10 minimum) will be acceptable.
Tumor tissue [formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival or recent acquisition] must be received by the central vendor (block or unstained slides) in order to randomize a subject to study treatment. (Note: Fine Needle Aspiration [FNA] and bone metastases samples are not acceptable for submission)
Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens
Availability of a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block of cancer tissue from the original or most recent biopsy for mutational analysis; availability must be confirmed prior to enrollment
Availability of fresh and archive tumor in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
PART A: Existing formalin fixed paraffin embedded biopsy of the lung cancer with potentially sufficient material for analysis
Archival Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor material if available
Adequate tissue sample from either archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue or new biopsy of tumor
Availability of a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block containing tumor tissue or 7 unstained tumor slides suitable for PD-L1 expression assessment.
Availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or unstained slides to demonstrate HER2 expression.
Availability of archival tumor tissues (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue block or 10-15 unstained slides)
Availability of tumor tissue from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) core biopsy of breast primary tumor
Tumor tissue from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores (FFPE) core biopsy of breast primary tumor that is confirmed as evaluable for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation status by central histopathology laboratory
Availability of a representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimen
Availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue, either fresh core-needle-biopsied or archived
Availability of a pretreatment tumor biopsy (excluding fine needle aspiration and cytology samples) taken after the subject has discontinued sorafenib and within 28 days before the day of first dosing with MSC2156119J. From the pretreatment biopsy either a formalin-fixed (formalin fixation is mandatory) paraffin-embedded block with tumor tissue (preferred) or at least 15 unstained slides must be sent to the central laboratory prior to enrollment. An associated pathology report must also be sent with the sample
Consent to submit a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor (FFPE) tissue block or freshly cut unstained, serial tumor slides from the most recently collected tumor tissue for central molecular analysis:
Participants with confirmed availability of representative tumor specimens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks (preferred), or sectioned tissue
Consent to the collection of an archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block or freshly cut unstained tumor slides from archival tumor tissue or a newly collected tumor sample
There must be availability of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimen with adequate viable tumor tissue
Local pathology review for histological confirmation; A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor block or appropriately stained slides from a fresh biopsy is required.
Availability of a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block of cancer tissue from the original surgery or biopsy or from a biopsy of recurrent disease
All participants must consent to provide archived diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and on study biopsies.
Participants should be able to submit 20 unstained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides from the initial tissue diagnosis prior to study registration for confirmation of diagnosis and correlative studies
The availability of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded archival tissue from core biopsy of tumors is recommended for exploratory analysis
Confirmation of availability of sufficient tissue from a prior surgery for correlative studies is required prior to enrollment; patients must have representative non-transitional cell carcinoma (non-TCC) or the urothelial tract formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tumor specimens (tumor blocks or 30 unstained slides; preference for tumor blocks); these samples may be submitted between the time of consent and the start of treatment; patients with < 30 slides may be enrolled after discussion with the principal or co-principal investigators
Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (blocks preferred) or at least 15 unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, for central testing and determined to be evaluable for tumor PD-L1 expression prior to study enrollment; participants who have fewer than 15 unstained slides available at baseline (but no less than [<] 10) may be eligible following discussion with the Medical Monitor
Patient must be able to provide a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimen prior to treatment. The specimen may have been taken at any time during the course of the disease and may be from the primary tumor or from a metastasis
