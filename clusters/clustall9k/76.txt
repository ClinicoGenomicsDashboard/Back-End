Concurrent diagnosis of invasive or microinvasive breast cancer in either breast
Subjects must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer and registration must occur within 12 months after the first histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer\r\n* A core biopsy interpreted as invasive cancer meets this criterion; if no core biopsy is performed, the date of first histologic diagnosis will be the date of first surgical procedure that identifies invasive cancer (biopsy, lumpectomy or mastectomy)\r\n* Neoadjuvant subjects should have no evidence of clinical T4 disease prior to chemotherapy and surgery; eligibility for neoadjuvant patients can be defined by either clinical stage prior to therapy or pathologic stage at surgery; if patient is eligible based on either, they are eligible for the study\r\n* Bilateral breast carcinoma is allowed provided either:\r\n** Diagnoses are synchronous – that is, within 3 months of one another – and at least one of the two breast carcinomas meet the eligibility criteria and neither is Her-2 positive or inflammatory; OR\r\n** The contralateral breast cancer was at least 5 years prior to the current diagnosis\r\n* No evidence of metastatic disease
