Mifepristone inhibits cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) and induces CYP3A4; addition of mifepristone to a pre-existing drug regimen may cause a mild and temporary increase in plasma drug concentration of drugs with significant CYP3A4 metabolism; medications that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, St. John's wort may decrease plasma mifepristone levels; strong CYP3A4 inhibitor medications are expected to cause the largest increases in plasma mifepristone concentrations; mifepristone may increase the plasma drug concentration of concomitant medications with metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9)/cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8 (2C8)
