Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to randomization; pre-neoadjuvant therapy sentinel node biopsy is not permitted
Status post segmental mastectomy, after sentinel node biopsy and/or axillary node dissection (tumors < 5 mm in size do not require nodal assessment) or after mastectomy
Patients will have undergone axillary staging by sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND); patients must have at least one, but no more than three known positive lymph nodes (pN1a, pN1b or pN1c); patients with micrometastases as the only nodal involvement (pN1mi) are not eligible; patients with positive sentinel node are not required to undergo full axillary lymph node dissection; this is at the discretion of the treating physician; axillary node evaluation is to be performed per the standard of care at each institution
Breast imaging should include imaging of the ipsilateral axilla; for subjects with a clinically negative axilla, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed either before or after preoperative therapy at the discretion of the subject’s physicians; for subjects with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure will be performed to determine the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes
Adequate surgical treatment including resection of all clinically evident disease and ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection. Histologically complete resection (R0) of the invasive and ductal in situ tumor is required in case of breast conserving surgery as the final treatment. No evidence of gross residual disease (R2) is required after total mastectomy (R1 resection is acceptable). Axillary dissection is not required in patients with a negative sentinel-node biopsy before (pN0, pN+(mic)) or after (ypN0, ypN+(mic) neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
For Cohort A: include patients who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) without completion axillary lymph nodal dissection (ALND)
Status post segmental mastectomy or mastectomy and axillary node dissection with removal of at least 8 nodes
Axillary lymph node dissection or positive sentinel lymph node prior to start of neoadjuvant therapy
Patients with DCIS do not require an axillary staging procedure; for patients with invasive breast cancer (except T1mi), an axillary staging procedure should be performed (either sentinel lymph node biopsy alone or axillary dissection and the axillary node must be pathologically negative) and they should be pathologically node negative; Note: Patients with N0 (i+) tumors on sentinel lymph node mapping or dissection (i.e., if the tumor deposit is 0.2 mm or less as determined by immunohistochemistry or hematoxylin and eosin staining) will also be eligible
Stage I-III breast cancer with the following criteria met:\r\n* If node-negative or if node status unknown (because it was not assessed), tumor must be > 5 mm (T1b) of any hormone receptor subtype (document estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor [ER/PR] status: if some ER/PR staining is present, ER and PR negative are defined as being positive in < 10% cells [per local pathology read])\r\n* If node-positive (N1-N3), T1mi, T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, or T3 tumors are eligible\r\n** Definition of node-negative disease (when node status known): If the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy and/or a negative axillary dissection, then the patient is determined to be node-negative; axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters =< 0.2 mm by either hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or IHC will be considered node-negative; any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2 cm is considered a micrometastasis; patients with a micrometastasis are eligible; an axillary dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a positive sentinel node and management of the axilla will be left up to the treating provider; in cases where the specific pathologic size of lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the principal investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility; in these special situations, the investigator must document this approval in the patient medical record
Randomisation and the primary study intervention, including staging sentinel node biopsy, must be completed by 120 days of original diagnosis.
Patient unable or ineligible to undergo staging sentinel lymph node biopsy of the primary index lesion.
Patient has undergone surgery on a separate occasion to clear the lymph nodes of the probable draining lymphatic field, including sentinel lymph node biopsy, of the index melanoma.
Patients who underwent partial excisional biopsy, lumpectomy, segmental mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy or sentinel node biopsy and, therefore cannot be assessed for pathologic response accurately
Patients must have HER2-positive stage I histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast; patients must have node-negative (N0) or micrometastases (N1mi) breast cancer according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition\r\n* If the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy, then no further axillary dissection is required, and the patient is determined to be node-negative; if an axillary dissection, without sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed to determine nodal status, at least 6 axillary lymph nodes must be removed and analyzed and negative for the patient to be considered node-negative; axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters =< 0.2 mm by either hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be considered node-negative\r\n* Any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2 cm is considered a micrometastasis; patients with a micrometastasis are eligible; an axillary dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a micrometastasis found by sentinel node evaluation; in cases where the specific pathologic size of lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the principal investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility; the investigator must document approval in the patient medical record\r\n* Patients who have an area of a T1aN0, estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative cancer in addition to their primary Her2 positive tumor are eligible
Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage T0 , T1 or T2 (=< 3 cm) treated with lumpectomy and axillary node dissection with at least 6 nodes sampled or sentinel node biopsy; patients with up to 3 positive nodes without microscopic or macroscopic evidence of extracapsular extension are eligible; patients with DCIS are not required to have axillary staging
