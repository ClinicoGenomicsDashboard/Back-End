Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement may participate if the patient meets all of the following criteria:\r\n* At least 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery) to starting the study treatment\r\n* Clinically stable with respect to the CNS tumor at the time of screening\r\n* Not receiving steroid therapy\r\n* Not receiving enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications that were started for brain metastases
Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement may participate if:\r\n* Clinically stable with respect to the CNS tumor at the time of screening and > 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery) to the start of study treatment\r\n* Not receiving steroid therapy\r\n* Not receiving enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications that were started for brain metastases (these include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and vigabatrin)
Patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor or CNS tumor involvement; however, patients with metastatic CNS tumors may participate in this study if the patient is: \r\n* > 4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery)\r\n* Clinically stable with respect to the CNS tumor at the time of study entry \r\n* Not receiving steroid therapy in treating CNS tumor or CNS tumor involvement\r\n* Not receiving anti-convulsive medications (that were started for brain metastases)
