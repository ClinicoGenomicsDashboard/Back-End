Part B1: Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
Assessment of HER2 status in subjects with gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma should follow the criteria published by Rüschoff et al (2012) as practicable.
All subjects with breast and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancers should have HER2 testing performed using an assay kit/methodology specifically FDA-approved for their cancer type as practicable.
Participants must have a history of advanced gastric cancer (AGC), defined as\n             unresectable and locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, including\n             adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), and must have experienced\n             disease progression during or after first-line therapy for their disease

The primary tumor must originate in the esophagus; tumors that involve the gastroesophageal (GE) junction must meet Sievert type 1 criteria: “adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus which usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of the oesophagus (i.e. Barrett’s oesophagus) and which may infiltrate the esophagogastric junction from above;” for the purposes of this protocol, this will be interpreted as: greater than 50% of the tumor must be above the GE junction or, alternatively, the tumor must involve the GE junction and arise in the setting of biopsy-documented Barrett’s esophagus (specialized intestinal metaplasia)
