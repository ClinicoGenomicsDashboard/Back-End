Individuals who are not a good candidate for BCG in their treating physician’s opinion
BCG-unresponsive high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer after treatment with adequate BCG therapy
Patients with bladder CIS, or completely resected high grade Ta/T1 lesions that are BCG unresponsive; unresponsive is BCG refractory and/or BCG relapsing\r\n* BCG refractory: persistent high-grade disease at 6 months despite receiving at least 5-6 induction instillations and at least one maintenance (two of three instillations) in a 6 month period\r\n* BCG relapsing: recurrence of high-grade disease after achieving a disease-free state at 6 months after receiving at least 5-6 induction instillations and at least one maintenance (two of three instillations) in a 6 month period
Prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy for metastatic urothelial cancer; prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with first progression > 12 months is allowed; prior intravesical treatments such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) are allowed, however no BCG is allowed within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment
Patients have failed at least one previous induction course of intravesical BCG, defined as histologically confirmed persistent or relapsing tumor present on post-BCG endoscopic evaluation; all BCG failures will be considered for inclusion into the study, including BCG-refractory, -resistant, and -relapsing; for the purposes of the study, “BCG-refractory” and “BCG-resistant” subjects will be considered to have “BCG-persistent” disease
Previous intolerance to BCG intravesical therapy suggested by development of systemic BCG infection in the past and/or grade 4 or greater adverse effect by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0
Are \BCG Unresponsive\ which refers to patients with high-grade NMIBC who are unlikely to benefit from and who will not receiving further intravesical BCG. The term \BCG unresponsive\ includes patients who did not respond to BCG treatment and have a persistent high-grade recurrence within 12 months after BCG was initiated, and those who despite an initial complete response (CR) to BCG, relapse with high-grade CIS within 12 months of their last intravesical treatment with BCG or relapse with high-grade Ta/T1 NMIBC within 6 months of their last intravesical treatment with BCG. The following criteria define the patients who may be included in the study:
Have received at least 2 previous courses of BCG within a 12 month period - defined as at least 5 of 6 induction BCG instillations and at least 2 out of 3 instillations of maintenance BCG, or at least two of six instillations of a second induction course, where maintenance BCG is not given
Exception: those who have T1 high-grade disease at first evaluation after induction BCG alone (at least 5 of 6 doses) may qualify in the absence of disease progression
At the time of tumor recurrence, patients with CIS alone or high-grade Ta/T1 with CIS should be within 12 months of last exposure to BCG and patients with Ta/T1 without CIS should be within 6 months of last exposure to BCG
No maximum limit to the amount of BCG administered
previous intravesical BCG therapy, which can be given at least 5 weeks before the diagnostic biopsy required for entry into the study
Subjects must have received adequate BCG treatment defined as at least 2 courses of BCG, i.e., at least one induction and one maintenance course or at least 2 induction courses. The initial induction course must be at least 5 treatments within a 7-week period. The second course (induction or maintenance) must be at least 2 treatments within a 6-week period. The \5+2\ doses of BCG must be given within approximately 1 year (i.e., the start of one course to start of the second course within 12 months ±1 month) and for the same disease episode for which the subject is enrolling. Treatment must be considered \full-dose\ BCG (see Section 10). If additional doses or courses of BCG above the minimum \5+2\ are given, these do not have to be within the same approximate 12 month timeframe. Subjects who were unable to receive at least 5 doses of BCG in a first course and at least 2 doses of BCG in a second course due to intolerance are not eligible. Subjects who began their initial course of BCG with \full-dose\ BCG and required dose-reductions due to adverse events but are still able to tolerate at least \5+2\ doses of BCG are considered to meet the requirement for \adequate BCG.\ Subjects who received less than \full dose\ BCG (e.g., 1/3rd dosing) as a standard regimen and not due to dose reductions because of AEs are not eligible. The BCG may have been given in combination with interferon. When BCG is given simultaneously in combination with interferon, 1/3rd dosing of BCG is acceptable.
The subject's disease is refractory or has relapsed following adequate BCG treatment. Refractory disease is defined as disease which persists at the first evaluation following adequate BCG. Relapsed disease is defined as having a complete response to adequate BCG but recurs at a subsequent evaluation. Subjects will enroll into one of three cohorts based on their type of disease and the time to refractory/relapsed disease following their last dose of BCG as follows:
Cohort 1: Subjects with CIS with or without associated papillary disease whose disease is determined to be refractory or relapsed within 6 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment.
Cohort 2: Subjects with CIS with or without associated papillary disease whose disease is determined to be refractory or relapsed more than 6 months but within 11 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment.
Patients must have received at least two or more prior courses of intravesical therapy per recommended schedules. BCG must have been one of the prior therapies administered.
Patients can have either failed BCG induction therapy within a six-month period or have been successfully treated with BCG, but subsequently found to have recurrence. The first standard course of intravesical BCG therapy must include at least six weekly treatments (allowable range of instillations per course is 4-9). The second course of BCG therapy must include at least two weekly treatments.
disease recurrence within 18 months of BCG maintenance OR
disease recurrence within 24 months of BCG induction
Patients must have a high grade urothelial carcinoma stage Ta or T1 that has recurred within 540 days after completion of the initial treatment (transurethral resection bladder tumor [TURBT] and intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG] immunotherapy) or on initial presentation with a T1 high grade tumor, the participating urologist judged BCG therapy is contraindicated or unsuitable because the patient is found to be intolerant of BCG therapy or because this patient may be immuno-compromised in ways other than that mentioned in severe, active co-morbidity or because the patient refuses BCG therapy
Active tuberculosis or bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection
Administration of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) within 4 weeks before cycle 1, day 1
Any approved anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment o Administration of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) > 4 weeks before cycle 1, day 1 is allowed
The patient must have BCG refractory or recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer\r\n* Refractory disease is defined as evidence of persistent high risk bladder cancer (high grade Ta, T1 and/or CIS) at the first cystoscopic exam after the initial 6 week induction course of BCG or at the 6 month cystoscopic exam\r\n* Recurrent disease is defined as reappearance disease after achieving a tumor- free status by 6 months following a full induction course of BCG with or without maintenance BCG; participants must have recurred with high grade and/or invasive disease within 18 months following the last dose of BCG\r\n** Low-grade superficial (Ta) disease will not be considered recurrent\r\n** Patients must exhibit disease recurrence receiving some form of standard intravesical therapy that must include a minimum of one induction course of BCG and may also include prior exposure to mitomycin, interferon, single agent gemcitabine or taxane therapy or maintenance
Not have received bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or have completed previous BCG treatment > 12 months prior to the baseline staging procedure.
