Baseline arterial blood pressure (BP) >= 140/90 mmHg, despite pharmacologic treatment with antihypertensive agents; if the arterial BP measurements at screening are >= 140/90 mmHg in a patient not on pharmacologic treatment for hypertension (HTN), we will initiate pharmacologic therapy and reassess the parameters after 1 week; at that time, patient will be eligible for enrollment on the study if arterial BP is found < 140/90 mmHg on antihypertensive therapy
Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained stage 2 hypertension, i.e., systolic blood pressure [BP] >= 160 mmHg or diastolic BP >= 100 mmHg) with or without medical therapy
Poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >= 160 mmHg or diastolic BP >= 100 mmHg) on three or more readings in the past 12 months
Severe hypertension (diastolic BP > 100 on medication)
All patients must also have 3 pre-op blood pressures (BP) to average for determining individual perioperative BP goal; it is preferred to utilize office visit BP's to reduce \whitecoat\ effect seen the morning of surgery
Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg), or as determined by the investigator during screening.
Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) greater than or equal to 160/100, or below 90/50 (one re-screen allowed)
Severe hypertension (diastolic BP > 100 on medication)
Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >= 160 mmHg or diastolic BP >= 95 mmHg)
Uncontrolled hypertension, blood pressure (BP) > 150/100 mmHg; patients with elevated BP may enroll once BP is corrected
