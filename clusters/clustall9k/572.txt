There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy to study registration except if there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria; when the interval is less than 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy, the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scan is allowed to differentiate between unequivocal evidence of tumor recurrence and pseudo progression
International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) version 7, stage IV disease; or recurrence after prior surgery or radiotherapy
Patients who develop a recurrence or progression (WHO criteria) of an MPNST in a previously radiated field may be enrolled if it has been at least 4 weeks since the last dose of radiation therapy
Patients must have pathologically confirmed recurrence at the time of catheter placement
Patients must have measurable or non-measurable (evaluable) disease recurrence\r\n* Recurrence must be documented based on a combination of clinical and imaging parameters, consistent with routine clinical practice, with or without histologic confirmation\r\n* Patients may have had any number of relapses and be eligible for the study
Any patient eligible for internal implantation without MR guidance will be considered eligible for this protocol; standard criteria for internal implantation include:\r\n* Carcinoma of the cervix: stage I-IVA or vaginal recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the uterus: stage IIIB (vaginal involvement), inoperable, or vaginal recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the vagina: stage I-IVA or vaginal recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the vulva: stage I-IVA or recurrence\r\n* Carcinoma of the urethra/bladder
No other signs of clinical recurrence or dissemination of prostate cancer as defined by normal CT-scan or MRI of the pelvis without local recurrence, and bone scan negative for metastases, and chest X-ray negative for metastases; prostascint scans will not be used to assess disease prior to study entry
Positive clinical and radiologic assessments for local or regional recurrence of disease at the time of study entry.
Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI scan and should have failed radiation therapy. The scan done prior to study entry documenting progression will be reviewed by the treating physician to document changes in tumor dimension to confirm recurrence. Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis.
Patients who have had a previous malignancy unless they are deemed by their treating physicians to be at low risk for recurrence
Have received at least one any prior treatment for local recurrence or metastatic disease and have relapsed
Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced breast cancer that is refractory to chemotherapy or other therapeutic agents or with a history of breast cancer with new evidence of a local recurrence (defined as a chest wall or breast recurrence and/or nodal recurrence); the diagnosis will be made based on clinical and pathologic features
First recurrence (based on radiological or histological evidence of recurrence)
Second or subsequent recurrence
History of cancer (other than GBM) within the past 2 years that has metastatic or local recurrence potential and could negatively impact survival and/or potentially confound tumor response assessments within this study.
Has the subject had histologically proven HGG with recurrence or progression following initial definitive therapy(s) such as surgery with or without adjuvant radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy (confirmed by diagnostic biopsy or contrast-enhanced MRI and evaluable by Macdonald criteria)? Note, if first recurrence of HGG is documented by MRI, an interval of at least 12 weeks after the end of prior radiation therapy is required unless there is either: i) histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor, or ii) new enhancement on MRI outside of the radiotherapy treatment field.
Subjects that have had more than one disease recurrence
Refractory disease on most recent therapy, or disease recurrence following remission on most recent therapy;
Tumor progression or recurrence within 6 months of last dose of platinum therapy that was used to treat metastatic, persistent or recurrent cervical cancer
more than 2 recurrences including present recurrence
Histologically documented recurrent/metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast with a recurrence on the chest wall (or its overlying skin):
The recurrence to be treated needs to be the 1st or 2nd recurrence of the AG or GBM
Patients may have had treatment (including radiotherapy) for any number of relapses prior to this recurrence
Other than surgery, patients may not have therapy for this recurrence (including radiation); supportive care such as steroids or anti-epileptics does not constitute treatment of recurrence
Patient had recurrence of osteosarcoma, localized to the lungs, had complete surgical removal of all lung nodules are eligible for enrollment.
Patient had recurrence of osteosarcoma in the lung following standard therapy including: adriamycin, cisplatin, ifosfamide and methotrexate.
Within 0-5 years post-active treatment for initial diagnosis or recurrence
Evidence of breast cancer recurrence or metastasis
Current recurrence of their breast cancer (BC) (local or distant)
Have not had recurrence
Participants who develop treatment complications or disease recurrence after being enrolled in the study may continue to participate if they are able to do so
Have not had a cancer recurrence
Malignant tumors other than HNC within the last 5 years, unless treated definitively and with low risk of recurrence in the judgment of the treating investigator
No local or distant recurrence of their breast cancer
Evidence of active progression of disease or recurrence
Participants who develop treatment complications or disease recurrence after being enrolled in the study may continue to participate if they are able to do so
Have not experienced a cancer recurrence, and
No evidence of recurrence
Patients with local disease recurrence would be excluded from the trial
May be receiving maintenance therapy that has a goal of prevention of recurrence but there should be no expectations for further active treatment
Evidence of biochemical recurrence
Evidence of tumor recurrence/progression by MRI (RANO criteria) post standard initial therapy.
Other completely resected stage 1 solid tumor with low risk for recurrence
Known recurrence of breast cancer (local, regional or distant) at any time prior to study entry.
Patient must not have planned treatment with immunotherapies (vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, T-cells); if the patient’s most recent recurrence occurs while on immunotherapy, this must be judged as true recurrence using Immunotherapy Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (iRANO) criteria
Sufficient tumor specimen thought to be available to meet the minimum requirements for profiling from diagnosis or progression/recurrence; OR
If prior treatment with radiation or ablative therapy, evidence of recurrence outside the confines of prior treated site(s) is needed.
Patients presenting with a CNS tumor presumed to be resectable and are at risk for local recurrence on pre-operative assessment
Evidence of prostate cancer recurrence (biochemical relapse by the Phoenix definition, enlarging palpable prostatic abnormality, imaging evidence strongly suggestive of local failure)
Patients who initiated androgen deprivation therapy or other systemic therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy) for PSA recurrence; nutritional supplements used for treatment of PSA recurrence will be allowed
Participants will be excluded if they have a recurrence that requires anti-cancer treatment
Evidence of biochemical recurrence
The patient must be at low- or low-intermediate risk for disease recurrence and progression according to the EAU guidelines
