Patients who have undergone a non-myeloablative stem cell transplant must have > 80% donor hematopoiesis within 30 days of study enrollment; chimerism within 30 days of study entry must be greater than, equal to, or no more than 5% less than the chimerism measured at approximately day +30 (if performed)
Patients who have undergone a non-myeloablative stem cell transplant must have > 65% donor lymphoid hematopoiesis within 30 days of study enrollment
ELIGIBILITY FOR MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING
Myeloablative preparative regimen

Patients who received Allo-Stem cell Transplantation(Allo-SCT) within 12 months.
Completed allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) or are eligible for and willing to complete allo-SCT
Any patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and willing to undergo allo-SCT as determined at time of screening for trial; patients who are ineligible or not interested in undergoing allo-SCT will be eligible for the trial
Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, with the exception of virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation prior to allo BMT
PHASE I: For the post allo-HCT cohort, chimerism analysis must demonstrate > 95% either donor or recipient in peripheral blood CD3 cells, must be done within 1 month of enrollment (no mixed chimerism are eligible)
Patients with Allo-SCT on active GVHD or immunosuppression therapy within 3 months prior to C1D1.
Acceptable allogeneic stem cell donor with imminent plans to proceed with allo-SCT.
Allo-HSCT within 90 days of leukapheresis
Prior allo-HCT less than three months from the time of enrollment
Previous allo-HSCT of any kind
Allowed prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) regardless of stem cell source; patients must be at least 3 months post allo-HCT (at time of treatment start); mismatched transplantations would be allowed
If post allo-HCT, then patient must have baseline donor T cell chimerism of >= 20% (from peripheral blood); evaluation can be made within 4 weeks of treatment start

Has received more than 1 allo-HSCT.
Subjects with evidence of relapsed primary disease, or subjects who have been treated for relapse after the allo-HSCT was performed.
Unresolved toxicity or complications (other than acute GVHD) due to previous allo-HSCT.
Received Janus kinase inhibitor therapy after allo-HSCT for any indication. Treatment with a JAK inhibitor before allo-HSCT is permitted.
Inadequate recovery from toxicity and/or complications from the prior allo-HSCT.
Patients underwent allo-SCT with intermediate risk and high risk AML and high risk MDS (defined by American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [ASBMT] criteria), who are within 60 to 100 days after allo-SCT
