Subjects who have received prior therapy with any T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways such as anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2), anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)137; or other medicines specifically targeting T cells are prohibited; prior therapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is permitted; prior interleukin (IL)-2 is permitted
Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1), anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1), or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (i.e., cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 [OX-40], necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9 [CD137]) or has previously participated in a Merck pembrolizumab (MK-3475) clinical trial.
Prior therapy with experimental antitumor vaccines; any T-cell co-stimulation agents or inhibitors of checkpoint pathways, such as anti- programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti- programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti- programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2), anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody; or other agents specifically targeting T cells are prohibited. However, for dose escalation, prior treatment with the marketed inhibitors of the immune checkpoint pathway, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, is allowed. In addition, in each of the expansion cohorts, 6 response-evaluable participants with prior exposure to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents will be allowed to enroll.
Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1), anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T cell receptor (such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], OX-40, CD137) or has previously participated in Merck pembrolizumab (MK-3475) clinical studies.
Have received prior treatment with an anti PD-1, anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) agent.
