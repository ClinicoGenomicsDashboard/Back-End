DONOR: If there is more than one donor with the least amount of HVG allele mismatches, the following prioritization will be used: (will always minimize HVG mismatch as highest priority)\r\n* ABO compatibility (in order of priority)\r\n** Compatible or minor ABO incompatibility\r\n** Major ABO incompatibility\r\n* Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status\r\n** The CMV status of the pair donor-recipient is frequently employed to select a potential donor; this is a controversial issue and the data available is somewhat limited; the following guidelines are recommended:\r\n*** For a CMV seronegative recipient, use a CMV seronegative donor\r\n*** For a CMV seropositive recipient, use a CMV seropositive donor\r\n* In CMV- patients with CMV+ stem-cell donors, primary CMV infection/reactivation develops in about 30%; data from the European Registry shows the following: seropositive patients receiving grafts from CMV+ HLA-identical sibling donors had the same survival as patients grafted from CMV- donors; however, matched unrelated donor (MUD) recipients receiving grafts from CMV+ donors had an improved 5-year survival, an improved event-free survival, and a reduced transplant-related mortality; there was no influence on the relapse incidence; the effects of donor CMV status remained in multivariate analyses; the effect of donor status was different among different disease categories; in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, T-cell depletion abrogated the beneficial effect of donor status, suggesting that the effect is mediated through transfer of donor immunity; these data suggest that donor CMV status influences outcome of unrelated stem cell transplant (SCT)
DONOR: The cytomegalovirus (CMV) status of the pair donor-recipient is frequently employed to select a potential donor; the following guidelines are recommended:\r\n* For a CMV seronegative recipient, use a CMV seronegative donor\r\n* For a CMV seropositive recipient, use a CMV seropositive donor

Have a documented asymptomatic CMV infection, with a screening value of CMV DNA >=2730 IU/mL to less than or equal to (<=) 273000 IU/mL in whole blood or >=910 IU/mL to <=91000 IU/mL in plasma in 2 consecutive assessments, separated by at least 1 day, as determined by local or central specialty laboratory quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or comparable quantitative CMV DNA results. Both samples should be taken within 14 days prior to randomization with second sample obtained within 5 days prior to randomization. Same laboratory and same sample type (whole blood or plasma) should be used for these assessments. Asymptomatic CMV infection is defined as an infection that does not present with tissue invasive CMV disease, as assessed by the investigator.

Note: A subject who is receiving these anti-CMV agents must discontinue their use before the first dose of study treatment. A subjects who may be receiving cidofovir must discontinue this antiviral at least 14 days prior to randomization at Visit 2/Day 0 and the first dose of study treatment. Note: Subjects who were administered these anti-CMV agents for prophylaxis, should have these treatments completed at least 2 weeks prior to the study entry or start of the treatment for current infection, whichever comes first and have undetectable CMV DNA (based on local laboratory) for at least two weeks between the completion of this treatment and onset of the current infection.
