Radiographically measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1.
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SECOND-LINE THERAPY: Radiographically measurable disease
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THIRD-LINE THERAPY: Radiographically measurable disease
Pediatric patients with radiographically recurrent or radiographically progressive non-hematologic malignancies (central nervous system [CNS] or solid tumors) associated with activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway will be eligible
PHASE II: Patients with measurable radiographically recurrent or radiographically progressive disease that is measurable in at least two dimensions on imaging after standard up-front therapy as defined in the following three strata below will be eligible\r\n* Stratum 1: patients with radiographically recurrent or radiographically progressive low-grade gliomas with a BRAF KIAA1549 (or similar) truncated fusion duplication not previously treated with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor\r\n* Stratum 2: patients with NF1 and radiographically recurrent or radiographically progressive LGG (NF1 may be defined clinically or genetically) not previously treated with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor\r\n* Stratum 3: patients with radiographically recurrent or radiographically progressive tumors thought to involve the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway but not included in Stratum 1 or 2; this includes any radiographically recurrent or radiographically progressive LGG not included in Stratum 1 or 2 (i.e., any LGG without a BRAF truncated fusion in a patient without NF1), any CNS tumor other than LGG in a patient with NF1, and any other CNS or solid tumor (regardless of grade) with a documented activating BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS mutation
Patients with clinical progression but without radiographically recurrent or radiographically progressive disease
Part 2 only: Presence of radiographically measurable disease (defined as the presence of ?1 lesion that measures ?10 mm [?15 mm for lymph nodes]). Measurable disease that was previously radiated is only permitted if progressing.
