Availability of an 8/8 matched donor at A, B, C, and DR loci; mismatch at human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ are permissible; matched related or unrelated donors are acceptable; peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cells are acceptable
All candidates for this study must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (A, B, C, DR) identical siblings who is willing to donate bone marrow or primed blood stem cells or a 10/10 allele matched unrelated donor; a single allele mismatch at A, B, C, DR or DQ and a killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatch at C will be allowed; all ABO blood group combinations of the donor/recipient are acceptable
Patient with no matched related donor who has a related haploidentical donor identified (=< 7/8 allele match at the A, B, C, DR loci) who is willing to undergo a bone marrow harvest and an NK cell collection approximately 2 weeks of the recipient's admission for transplant; the donor must be 16 years of age or older and weigh at least 110 pounds
MATCHED RELATED DONOR: Related donor matched at 9/10 or 10/10 HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing 63
MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated donor matched at 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-A, B, C, major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1 (DRB1), and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1 (DQB1) loci by high resolution typing
Patient must have an identified HLA (A,B,C,DR) compatible related or unrelated donor who is age 16 years of age or older and weighs at least 110 pounds for the stem cell donation
Must have matched unrelated donor (8 of 8 HLA match at A, B, C, and DR loci) by high resolution deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) typing
MATCHED RELATED DONOR: Related donors matched at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing (10/10 antigen/allele match) are acceptable donors; alternatively, a 9/10 matched related donor can be used
MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated donor matched at 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing
DONOR: HLA-genotypically or phenotypically 1 to 3 antigen mismatched (at the A, B, DR loci) related donors will be acceptable
Recipient of mismatched (allele or antigen level) graft in more than one loci of HLAA, -B, -C or â€“DR loci will not be eligible, i.e. recipients of 2-antigen or 2-allelele mismatched graft
Histocompatible stem cell donor: patients must have an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related or unrelated donor (HLA A, B, C and DR) willing to donate for allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation; high resolution allele level typing is required for donors other than genotypically identical siblings
MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated donor matched at HLA-A, B, C, and DR loci by high resolution typing (at 8/8 or 7/8 antigen/allele match) are acceptable donors
Related or unrelated donor which is HLA-matched or mismatched in 1 HLA A, B, C, DR, or DQ locus is acceptable (i.e. >= 9/10 matched related or unrelated donor, matched with molecular high-resolution technique per current standard [std.] for bone marrow transplant [BMT] program); cord blood units must match patient at 4, 5, or 6/6 HLA class 1 serological & II molecular antigens with a minimum (min.) of 2 x 10^7 total number of nucleated cells (TNC)/kg recipient weight in the pre-thawed fraction; for patient lacking a matched related or unrelated donor or acceptable cord blood unit(s), a related haploidentical donor (=< 7/8 allele matched at A, B, C, DR loci) may be used
DONOR: Volunteer unrelated donor matched at a minimum of seven of eight loci (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1), by high resolution typing (> 7/8 allele match) are acceptable donors \r\n* The preferred donor-recipient pair would be matched at all eight loci (8/8 allele match)\r\n* When an 8/8 allele-matched unrelated donor is not available, a single mismatch at HLA-A, -B, -C, or DRB1 will be acceptable in patients who meet all eligibility criteria and are 18-69 years of age\r\n** In the situation where more than one 7/8 match is available donor recipient pairs matched at HLA-DQ will be used
Patients must have a related donor who is a two or more allele mismatch at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A; B; C; DR and DQ loci; patients who have sibling donors with a one antigen mismatch due to recombination will not be enrolled in this protocol

Medical clearance by Dr. Murphy
All candidates for this study must have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (A, B, C, DR) identical siblings who is willing to donate bone marrow or primed blood stem cells or an 8/8 allele-matched unrelated donor
7 out of 8 at high resolution using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based typing with either antigen or allele mismatched HLA (-A, -B, -C, and -DR) or 8/8 HLA-mismatched with either double DQ mismatch (10/12) or combined DQ and DP mismatch
Per Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) bone marrow transplant (BMT) program practices, an allele level matched (8/8 human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, C and DR) sibling or unrelated donor is preferred; if a matched donor is not found, mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donors may be considered
