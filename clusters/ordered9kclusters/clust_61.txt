Renal: serum creatinine within normal limits (WNL), defined as within 25% of the institution's stated reference range, or a calculated creatinine clearance >45 mL/min/1.73 m. sq. for patients with abnormal, increased, creatinine levels.
Serum creatinine within normal range, or if serum creatinine outside normal range, then glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 40 mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation with adjustment if total body weight is ? 125% of ideal body weight.
Serum creatinine within normal range, or if serum creatinine outside normal range, then GFR > 40 mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation with adjustment if total body weight is ? 125% of ideal body weight.
Serum creatinine =< 2 x upper limit of reference range or creatinine clearance >= 30 ml/min
Adequate renal function, as defined by estimated serum creatinine clearance >= 60 ml/min and a normal serum creatinine for age
Serum creatinine within normal range
Creatinine =< 1.2 x normal range prior to biopsy
Serum creatinine within normal range, or if serum creatinine outside normal range, then renal function (measured or estimated creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) > 40mL/min/1.73 m^2
Serum creatinine within normal range with a creatinine clearance >= 30 ml/min
Serum creatinine within normal range for age, or if serum creatinine outside normal range for age, then renal function (creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) > 40 mL/min/1.73m^2
Serum creatinine =< 1.2 mg/dl or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 40 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated)
Serum creatinine =< 1.2 mg/dL or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 40 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated)
Serum creatinine within normal range for age, or if serum creatinine outside normal range for age, then renal function (creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) > 40 mL/min/1.73m^2
Renal: serum creatinine within normal limits (WNL), defined as within 10% of the institution's stated reference range, or a calculated creatinine clearance >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with abnormal, increased, creatinine levels. Patients with Multiple Myeloma (only): serum creatinine ? 2.5 the institutional upper limit of the normal range and a calculated creatinine clearance > 40 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 40 ml/min) or liver insufficiency (serum bilirubin > 2 times the upper normal range and/or serum transaminases (AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, but not gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase) >3 times the upper normal range). Creatinine clearance may be calculated according to validated formulas (Crockoft's or MDRD)
Serum creatinine within 1.5 x normal range for age OR creatinine clearance with a recommended eGFR ? 50 mL/min/1.73m^2
Serum creatinine within 1.5 x normal range for age OR creatinine clearance with a recommended eGFR ? 50 mL/min/1.73m^2
Renal: serum creatinine (SCr) within normal range for age (see table 2.3). If SCr is outside normal range for age, creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 40 mL/min/1.73m2 must be obtained (measured by 24-hour (hr) urine specimen or nuclear glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or calculated GFR (by Cockcroft-Gault formula for those aged ? 18 years; by Original Schwartz estimate for those < 18 years))
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range, or, if serum creatinine > 1.5 x the upper limit or normal range, then the creatinine clearance must be >= 60 mL/min
Serum creatinine =< 1.2 mg/dl or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 40 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated) with dose adjustment for fludarabine for < 70 ml/min
Subjects with a determination of renal function based on: serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 60-ml/min/1.73 m^2
Renal: serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 40 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated)
Renal: serum creatinine =< 1.2 mg/dl or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 40 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated) with dose adjustment of fludarabine for < 70 ml/min
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x normal
Renal: Serum creatinine within normal range for age, or if serum creatinine outside normal range for age, then renal function (creatinine clearance or GFR) > 70mL/min/1.73m2.
Renal function: Age-adjusted normal serum creatinine is required. A 24-hour creatinine clearance value > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (updated Schwartz formula or nuclear GFR) must be obtained if serum creatinine is elevated.
Renal insufficiency or serum creatinine above the normal reference range
Renal: serum creatinine < 1.2 mg/dl or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated)
Serum creatinine within normal range, or if serum creatinine is outside normal range, then renal function (measured or estimated creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) >= 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2
Serum creatinine > 1.5 times upper reference range
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 times upper reference range
