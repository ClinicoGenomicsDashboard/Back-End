Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC, including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma (including bronchoalveolar cell), and large cell anaplastic carcinoma (including giant and clear cell carcinomas) and poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer; totally resected tumors are excluded
