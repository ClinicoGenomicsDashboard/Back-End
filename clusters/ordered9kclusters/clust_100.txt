ECG abnormalities as defined by the protocol
Cardiac abnormalities
Cardiac abnormalities
Anyone with cardiac abnormalities or history
Any of the following laboratory abnormalities:
Patients with uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities.
Patients must have a normal baseline ophthalmologic examination or have only clinically-insignificant abnormalities; patients with significant visual/ocular abnormalities identified during the baseline eye exam may be eligible after discussion with the study principal investigator (PI) and it is thought that the abnormalities pose no increased risk with study therapy
Any laboratory abnormalities, which in the opinion of the investigator, may put the subject at risk if participating in the study; for example:
De novo AML with karyotypic abnormalities characteristic of MDS: de novoAML must have cytogenetics with abnormalities per WHO.
