Female subjects are eligible to enter the study if they are either:\r\n* Of non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any woman who:\r\n** Has had a hysterectomy, or\r\n** Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy), or\r\n** Has had a bilateral tubal ligation, or\r\n** Is post-menopausal (demonstrates total cessation of menses for greater than or equal to 1 year)\r\nOR\r\n* Of childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following contraceptives\r\n** An intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year\r\n** Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the subjectâ€™s entry and is the sole sexual partner for that woman\r\n** Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigational product, during the clinical trial, and for at least 14 days after the last dose of investigational product\r\n** Double barrier contraception defined as condom with spermicidal jelly, foam, suppository, or film; OR diaphragm with spermicide; OR male condom and diaphragm
Subjects not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total cessation of menses for >= 1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in questionable cases, have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value > 40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value < 40 pg/mL (< 140 pmol/L); subjects must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment; for most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT; if a female subject is determined not to be post-menopausal, they must use adequate contraception
Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods stated in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.
