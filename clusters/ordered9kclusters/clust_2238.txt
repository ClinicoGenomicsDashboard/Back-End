Known history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of AML, ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), or blast-phase CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia)
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML):
Patients with mature B-cell ALL or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are in first or second complete remission
MRD positive leukemia (AML, ALL or accelerated/blast phase chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML]); selected patients in morphologic CR, but with positive immunophenotypic (flow cytometry) or molecular evidence of MRD may be eligible if recent chemotherapy has not resulted in MRD negative status
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Patients with a myeloid hematologic malignancy (acute myelogenous leukemia, secondary myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome) unlikely to be cure by standard chemotherapy; this includes patients who have relapsed after standard chemotherapy treatments and patients in first remission with unfavorable prognostics features
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients who have failed or are intolerant of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or patients with other myeloproliferative diseases who are high risk and the intent of therapy is cure
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic or accelerated phase; prior therapies allowed
Chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Patients must not have blastic transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia
Patients must have an initial diagnosis of AML, biphenotypic acute leukemia, or APL or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (accelerated, blast or second chronic phase)
Relapse after previous allogeneic stem cell transplant for one of the following hematologic malignancies - acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), lymphoma, myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia meeting the following:\r\n* For non-chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), relapse will be defined based on disease specific morphologic criteria from a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific cytogenetics; relapse can be determined morphologically; equivocal results for relapse should result in a repeated test after an appropriate time interval (suggested 1 month) to determine eligibility\r\n* For CML, relapse will be defined as any cytogenetic evidence of a Philadelphia chromosome or persistence of breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) rearrangements by molecular testing on at least two measurements over a 6 month interval; if cytogenetics are normal and there is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of a BCR/ABL fusion, patients will be eligible if they have evidence of a quantitative increase in CML measured either by quantitative PCR or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\r\n* For chronic phase CML patients only:\r\n** Must have failed (no response in 3 months or incomplete response at 6 months) or refused treatment with a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)\r\n** Must have failed (defined as incomplete response or relapse) or refused donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)
Pathologically confirmed, relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia
Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with relapsed or refractory disease who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation or other standard therapies
Subject has a history of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) including polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Current acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia
Myeloproliferative disorders to be included:\r\n* Idiopathic myelofibrosis\r\n* Polycythemia vera\r\n* Essential thrombocythemia\r\n* Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia\r\n* Chronic neutrophilic leukemia\r\n* Chronic eosinophilic leukemia\r\n* Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\r\n* Hypereosinophilic syndrome\r\n* Systemic mastocytosis
For patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, patientâ€™s disease must have evidence of never responded to or progressed after receiving a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (e.g. imatinib mesylate)
Patients with accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia may have =< 10% blasts in the peripheral smear or bone marrow at study entry
Lymphoblastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) All subjects with evidence of CNS leukemia must be treated and be in CNS CR to be eligible for trial.
Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in myeloid blasts crisis
Patients must have morphologically confirmed newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with blood or bone marrow disease; patients with only extramedullary disease in the absence of bone marrow or blood involvement are not eligible; note: this protocol uses World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for AML; patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, French-American-British [FAB], M3) or blastic transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are not eligible; patients with known core binding factor (CBF) or fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) related leukemias are eligible for this study, but should preferentially be placed on National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored protocols specific for these subtypes, if available
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in 1st or subsequent remission
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Subjects with any of the following will NOT be eligible for study:\r\n* Bone marrow involvement\r\n* Active myelogenous leukemia, or history of myelogenous leukemia\r\n* Pregnancy
Be diagnosed with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Re-induction of acute myelogenous or lymphocytic leukemia after primary relapse
Chronic Myelogenous leukemia
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
