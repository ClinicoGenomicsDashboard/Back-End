Patients must not have any serious or unstable pre-existing medical conditions (aside from malignancy exceptions specified above), including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics on day 1, history of bleeding diathesis or need for concurrent anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] =< 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time [PTT] within 1.1 x ULN), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, interfere with subjectâ€™s safety, or obtaining informed consent; therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of prothrombin time (PT)/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate; prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency
Patients requiring warfarin are not eligible
INR or prothrombin time (PT) < 1.5 x the ULN except for patients receiving anticoagulation, who must be on a stable dose of warfarin for 6 weeks prior to enrollment
Therapeutic anticoagulation with vitamin-K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) or with heparins and heparinoids; however, prophylactic anticoagulation as described below is allowed:\r\n* Low dose warfarin (1 mg orally, once daily) with prothrombin time (PT)-INR =< 1.5 x ULN is permitted; infrequent bleeding or elevations in PT-INR have been reported in some subjects taking warfarin while on regorafenib therapy; therefore, subjects taking concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in PT, PT-INR or clinical bleeding episodes\r\n* Low dose aspirin (=< 100 mg daily)\r\n* Prophylactic doses of heparin
Any patients on warfarin therapy
Patients being treated with Warfarin.

Patients taking warfarin; if anticoagulation is required, the patient must be on a stable dose of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anticoagulant other than warfarin (e.g. enoxaparin, dalteparin, fondaparinux, apixaban, rivaroxaban) for at least 30 days
Therapeutic anticoagulation with vitamin-K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) or with heparins and heparinoids\r\n* However, prophylactic anticoagulation as described below is allowed:\r\n** Low dose warfarin (1 mg orally, once daily) with PT-INR =< 1.5 x ULN is permitted; infrequent bleeding or elevations in PT-INR have been reported in some subjects taking warfarin while on regorafenib therapy; therefore, subjects taking concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in PT, PT-INR or clinical bleeding episodes\r\n** Low dose aspirin (=< 100 mg daily)\r\n** Prophylactic doses of heparin
Patients must not be receiving systemic anticoagulation with warfarin; patients must be off warfarin for 30 days prior to enrollment; patients who require anticoagulation with an agent other than warfarin will not be excluded, but must be reviewed by the principal investigator prior to enrollment
Currently using warfarin.
The patient is currently on warfarin or heparin therapy
Requires therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin at baseline\r\n* Patients must be off warfarin or warfarin-derivative anti-coagulants for at least 7 days prior to starting study drug, however, therapeutic or prophylactic therapy with low-molecular weight heparin is allowed
Currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin;
For patients requiring anti-coagulation with vitamin K antagonists, therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site. Exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR. Consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate. If clinically indicated, prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency.
Participants receiving oral warfarin are not eligible for this study (unless warfarin is discontinued at least 7 days prior to commencement of treatment and for the duration of the study, or oral warfarin is converted to LMWH, where local clinical opinion considers this an acceptable option).
Patients receiving therapeutic doses of warfarin
Patients on warfarin

Anticoagulation with warfarin
Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate; prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency
Requirement for anticoagulation with warfarin
Currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin;

Individuals who require therapy with warfarin
Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate; prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency
Patients receiving chronic or acute warfarin treatment are not excluded, but should be monitored very closely or considered for switch to other therapies. P1446A-05 is both highly protein bound and a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 at higher concentrations and thus may potentiate the action of warfarin in patients
