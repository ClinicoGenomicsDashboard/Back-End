Spinal cord compression or brain metastases
Patients with untreated brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis are excluded from this clinical trial; patients with brain metastases or spinal cord compression previously treated with radiation and/or surgery are allowed if local treatment was > 30 days ago, most recent MRI demonstrates stability or decrease in size of all lesions, and the patient has no current neurologic symptoms related to the metastases and treatment and no requirement for corticosteroids related to the prior treatment

Symptomatic or untreated spinal cord compression
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression
Patients with symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastasis or spinal cord compression
Have known untreated brain metastases, uncontrolled spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal disease.
Subject has symptomatic brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or intractable back pain due to compression of destructive mass.
Untreated symptomatic spinal cord compressions
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression.
Untreated spinal cord compression
Brain metastases or spinal cord compression.
Known spinal cord compression or brain or liver metastasis
Unstable brain metastases or spinal cord compression
Patients with known brain metastases or spinal cord compression should be excluded from this clinical trial
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression; treated brain metastases must have been stable for at least 1 month
Untreated brain metastasis or history of leptomeningeal disease or spinal cord compression.
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression
Untreated symptomatic spinal cord compressions
History of, or current metastases in the brain, meninges, or untreated spinal cord compression
History of, or current known metastases in the brain or untreated spinal cord compression
Uncontrolled brain or spinal cord metastases
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal, CNS or brain metastases or spinal cord compression at the time of transition to this study.
Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or intractable back pain due to a compressive or destructive mass
Patients with untreated spinal cord metastases or metastases close to vital organs (as determined by the principal investigator) are excluded
Untreated spinal cord compression.
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal disease or brain metastases or spinal cord compression
Untreated or inadequately treated spinal cord compression
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression.
Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord compression; treated brain metastases must have been stable for at least 1 month
Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases or spinal cord compression or any of these conditions requiring chronic steroids to control symptoms.
Subjects with CNS symptoms should undergo a CT scan or MRI of the brain to exclude new or progressive brain metastases. Spinal cord metastasis is acceptable. However, subjects with spinal cord compression should be excluded.
History of or known presence of brain or spinal cord metastases
Brain metastases or spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation, or previously treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases or spinal cord compression without evidence of stable disease for >/= 14 days

Untreated or symptomatic brain metastasis, leptomeningeal disease or spinal cord compression. Subjects who are on a stable dose of corticosteroids for more than 1 month or off corticosteroids for 2 weeks can be enrolled with approval of medical monitor. Subjects are not permitted to receive enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs.
