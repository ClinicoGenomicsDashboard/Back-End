Patients on any moderate or strong cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) inducer (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin) or inhibitor (e.g., amiodarone, fluconazole) are ineligible; CYP2C9 poor metabolizers will not be excluded
Patients on narrow-therapeutic drugs that are substrates for cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2), CYP2C9, cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19), and cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) are ineligible (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, phenytoin, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, theophylline, tizanidine, warfarin)
Use of potent cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (3A4) (CYP3A4) inhibitor within one week of pacritinib initiation
Need for medications that strongly induce or inhibit cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) or cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6) activity
Received potent cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or inducers; or substrates of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6) with narrow therapeutic indexes within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug
It should be noted that TAK-700 (orteronel) is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2), cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (2C9), and cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (2C19); caution should be employed when used with medications that are strong/moderate inhibitors, significant inducers or sensitive substrates with narrow therapeutic indices
Use of rifampin (strong cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 8 [CYP2C8] inducer) within 14 days of study day 1
Patients cannot be taking any cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2) pathway inhibiting or inducing agents (except proton pump inhibitors which are allowed) including cimetidine, antidepressants, antibiotics and all others
Patients who are currently receiving drugs that are strong or moderate inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) or sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range are not eligible; the use of aprepitant as an antiemetic is prohibited due to early drug interaction data demonstrating increased exposure to AZD1775; caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of AZD1775 and agents that are sensitive substrates of cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C polypeptide 8 (CYP2C8), family 2 subfamily C polypeptide 9 (2C9) and family 2 subfamily C polypeptide 19 (2C19), or substrates of this enzyme with narrow therapeutic ranges, as well as agents that are inhibitors or substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
