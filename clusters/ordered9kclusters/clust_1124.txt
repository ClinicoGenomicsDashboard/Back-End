Age ? 60 years with relapsed/refractory AML of any type except for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; AML M3), after at least 1 prior AML therapy , who have never undergone, and who are not currently eligible for, stem cell transplantation, and are currently deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy.
RR-AML
Patient must have one of the following histologically or cytologically documented measurable (may be measureable by tumor markers only, such as quantitative RT-PCR for WT1 transcript for AML, or CA-125 for ovarian carcinoma) advanced stage malignancies: non-small cell lung, ovarian, glioblastoma, and AML (not including acute promyelocytic leukemia), known to overexpress the WT1 protein.
Patient must have histologically or cytologically documented measurable (may be measurable by tumor markers only, such as quantitative RT-PCR for WT1 transcript for AML) advanced stage glioblastoma or AML (not including acute promyelocytic leukemia), known to overexpress the WT1 protein. Note: Determination of WT1 expression will not be assessed prior to patient enrollment.
Patients with secondary AML or therapy related disease (t-AML) are eligible
Histologically or cytologically confirmed AML, other than acute promyelocytic leukemia, as defined by the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria that is relapsed or refractory to standard chemotherapy; Note: newly-diagnosed AML patients who are 60 years or older and are not candidates for or have refused standard chemotherapy are also eligible for this trial
Diagnosed with AML according to the WHO 2008 classification. Note: subjects with secondary AML following Myelodysplastic syndrome or secondary to previous leukemogenic therapy are allowed provided that a record of previous MDS history or leukemogenic therapy history is available.
Previous AML treatment (other than hydroxyurea).
Patients diagnosed with AML meeting one of the following criteria:\r\n* Newly diagnosed, age 60 and older\r\n* High risk cytogenetics and molecular abnormalities (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] criteria)\r\n* Relapsed or refractory to prior chemotherapy\r\n* Secondary AML
Patient must not have received definitive treatment for AML, defined as any prior chemotherapy with antileukemic activity
The patient has a diagnosis of AML associated with karyotype t(15;17).
Patients with FLT3 ITD positive AML or AML patients with other cytogenetic abnormalities who are eligible for trials of other targeted investigational agents from which the investigator feels there is greater benefit.
Morphologically documented primary AML, prior-chemotherapy-related AML or AML secondary to an antecedent hematologic disorder (e.g., Myelodysplastic Syndrome) as defined by WHO criteria, confirmed by pathology review. For Cohort Expansion Phase (Part 2) only: Bone marrow involvement is required.
Have either relapsed or refractory AML, or who have newly diagnosed Flt3-ITD positive AML but either refuse or are considered by the Investigator not to be an appropriate candidate for standard chemotherapy.
