For Groups B or C patients must be off conventional therapy for at least 1 week prior to receiving treatment on this study
Patients should have been off conventional therapy for at least 1 week prior to receiving treatment on this study
Participants must be in first recurrence or have disease that is primarily refractory to conventional therapy
Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy: ?4 weeks
no effective conventional therapy exists
Patients should have been off conventional therapy for at least 1 week prior to entry in this study; PD1/PDL1 inhibitors will be allowed if medically indicated
Ineligible for or have declined initial conventional combination chemotherapy
Patients must have disease that is no longer considered responsive to available conventional modalities or treatments (failed any known standard curative or effective therapy for that disease).
Has known metastatic disease as determined by conventional staging studies.
Conventional or stereotactic pituitary radiotherapy any time in the past
Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically proven advanced solid tumor malignancy for which palliative radiation is recommended. In solid tumors where pembrolizumab has been approved for use, patients may receive pembrolizumab as indicated, in the context of this protocol; in solid tumors where pembrolizumab has not been approved for use, the following criteria apply:\r\n* Patients must be resistant to at least 1 prior conventional chemotherapy regimen or other standard of care regimen,\r\n* Patient must have no remaining conventional treatment options proven to provide long-term disease control, and\r\n* Patient has declined other conventional treatment options\r\nPalliative radiation therapy may be recommended for primary tumor and/or any metastatic site that is accessible to biopsy
Patients who have been treated with any combination of surgical resection and neoadjuvant/adjuvant conventional chemoradiation therapy for resectable disease or conventional chemoradiation as definitive treatment for unresectable or borderline resectable disease are eligible for the study, provided that at least 180 days have elapsed since completing any previous radiation treatment; patients who have been receiving continued chemotherapy following their initial radiation treatment are eligible regardless of when the most recent chemotherapy was received; those patients who have received prior radiation therapy will constitute Cohort A and will receive SBRT as 5 Gy x 5
Prior conventional radiation to the same site is allowed as long as there is a greater than 3 months interval
Progressive hemato-lymphoid malignancy despite conventional therapy
Tumor must be potentially surgically resectable and curable with conventional surgery and radiation therapy
Subjects must have had histologic verification by a pathologist of cancer at original diagnosis; the tumor must be a non-CNS solid tumor; for subjects to be enrolled on the intratumoral arm, at least one lesion must be amenable to HSV1716 injection without undue risk, as determined by the interventional radiologist; disease must be considered refractory to conventional therapy or for which no conventional therapy exists
All diseases are advanced hematologic malignancies not curable by conventional chemotherapy; responses to conventional treatment range from zero to 30% but are typically short lived
Patients must have central nervous system (CNS)/ leptomeningeal disease which is refractory to conventional therapies or for which no conventional therapy exists OR recurrent brain tumors with a predilection for leptomeningeal dissemination (primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET], rhabdoid tumor)
Conventional chemotherapy or radiation within 4 weeks.
Conventional chemotherapy or radiation within 4 weeks.
Failed conventional therapy for their cancer or have a malignancy for which a conventional therapy does not exist
Subjects who are resistant to conventional chemotherapy or have declined conventional therapy for TNBC; patients having received any prior line of systemic therapy for inoperable/recurrent or metastatic disease are eligible
Suitable for conventional single agent chemotherapy
IDH1 gene-mutated solid tumors refractory to conventional therapy or the subject does not tolerate the conventional therapy
Conventional chemotherapy or radiation within 4 weeks.
Patients who are curable by conventional multidisciplinary management.
4 weeks (28 days) from any radiation treatment, stereotactic radiosurgery, conventional surgery, or chemotherapy
Intercurrent illness likely to prevent protocol therapy or conventional planned therapy
Patients must have CNS/ leptomeningeal disease including high risk medulloblastoma, or a CNS/leptomeningeal malignancy which is refractory to conventional therapies, or for which no conventional therapy exists, OR a recurrent brain tumors with a predilection for leptomeningeal dissemination (medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET], rhabdoid tumor)
Tumor must be surgically resectable and curable with conventional surgery
Lack of suitable conventional donor
Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor that is considered incurable and is not amenable to conventional surgical, radiation therapy or chemotherapy treatment programs
Subjects who will need conventional therapy during the course of the study
Definitive findings of systemic metastasis on conventional imaging
Patients already scheduled to receive conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, vaccine therapy, or surgery as treatment (except at disease progression)
Able to undergo experimental imaging studies, as well as conventional bone and body imaging
