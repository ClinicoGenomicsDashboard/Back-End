Unable to undergo MRI
Pre-operative and post-operative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast must be obtained. The requirement for a post-operative MRI is waived for patients who undergo biopsy only. A spine MRI is not required, but may be obtained if clinically indicated. If the spine MRI is positive, the patient would be considered to have M+ disease (defined as neuraxis dissemination) and would be ineligible
MRI of the brain (or contrast CT scan of the brain if patients are unable to undergo MRI) must be obtained in patients with symptoms suggesting possible central nervous system (CNS) metastatic disease; neuroimaging is recommended but not required in asymptomatic patients
Patients who are unable to undergo MRI
Patients unable to undergo MRI exams.
Inability to undergo MRI evaluation for treatment planning and follow-up

Unable to undergo imaging by either CT scan or MRI
Contraindication for safe MRI, implants, or other conditions that interfere with imaging required for the study (e.g., pacemaker or non-MRI compatible hip prostheses); Note: subjects with bilateral hip implants are not eligible for the study; subjects with a unilateral hip implant may be eligible assuming the implant is MRI compatible and does not present artifact on MRI in the areas of interest
Unable to undergo MRI of the spine
Ability to have MRI as part of post-implant assessment
Patients unable to undergo an MRI of the brain with contrast.
The subject is unable to undergo MRI scan (eg, has pacemaker)
Inability to undergo MRI

Patient must be willing and able to undergo MRI as outlined in protocol
Patient must be able to undergo MRI with and without contrast; patients who are unable to undergo MRI are ineligible
Must be able to undergo MRI of abdomen (spleen and liver). Patients who are contra indicated for MRI may be enrolled and evaluated by CT scan at the discretion of the Sponsor.

Inability to undergo MRI evaluation for treatment planning and follow-up
Inability to undergo MRI with and without contrast (e.g. claustrophobia, non-MRI compatible implant or foreign body, gadolinium allergy or renal dysfunction preventing the patient from receiving gadolinium- institutional guidelines should be used to determine if patients are at risk for renal dysfunction); note that patients with severe claustrophobia are permitted on this study if they are willing and able to undergo MRI with adequate sedation or anesthesia
Ever been told not to get an MRI
MRI-incompatible metal implant\r\n* If a potential participant reports implanted metal objects, which might be affected by MRI magnets, the study personnel or MRI technologist will screen over the phone or in person to determine whether the potential participant would be safe during the MRI scan; a current list of implants compatible with MRI will be consulted
