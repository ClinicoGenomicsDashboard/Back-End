MATCHED RELATED DONOR: Presence of any blood transmissible infectious disease that cannot be cleared prior to stem cell collection and poses an unacceptable risk for the recipient (excludes cytomegalovirus [CMV])
No uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral disease (therapy for cytomegalovirus [CMV] viremia is permitted)
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR positive at baseline
Infections\r\n* ARM A: Without active uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infection\r\n** Cytomegalovirus (CMV)- If CMV viremia is < 137 IU/ml, but patients are on therapy for CMV\r\n** Human herpes virus (HHV)-6 < 40,000 copies/ML and without active trend up\r\n* ARM B: No limitation
Active cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease at the time of enrollment
Persistent or recurrent cytomegalovirus infection or disease despite at least 7 days of standard therapy or failure of therapy as described below or if unable to tolerate standard therapy. Standard therapy is defined as antiviral therapy with ganciclovir or CMX001 (brincidofovir) as the agents of choice and foscarnet or cidofovir as second line agents. i.Cytomegalovirus infection: defined as the presence of CMV positivity as detected by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or pp65 antigenemia or culture from ONE site such as stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx. ii. Cytomegalovirus disease: defined as the demonstration of CMV by biopsy specimen from visceral sites (by culture or histology) or the detection of CMV by culture or direct fluorescent antibody stain in broncheoalveolar lavage fluid in the presence of new or changing pulmonary infiltrates or changes consistent with CMV retinitis on ophthalmologic examination. iii. Failure of therapy: defined as a rise or a fall of less than 50% in viral load in peripheral blood or any site of disease as measured by PCR or pp65 antigenemia after 7 days of antiviral therapy.
Active infection including cytomegalovirus
Cytomegalovirus (CMV): Ongoing infection, treatment, or prophylaxis within the past 28 days
Patients will be eligible following any type of allogeneic transplant if they have CMV, adenovirus or EBV infection persistent to standard therapy (as defined below):\r\n* Prior myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant using either bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or single or double umbilical cord blood\r\n* CMV, adenovirus or EBV infection persistent despite standard therapy\r\n** For CMV infection:\r\n*** Patients with CMV disease defined as the demonstration of CMV by biopsy specimen from visceral sites (by culture or histology) or the detection of CMV by culture or direct fluorescent antibody stain in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the presence of new or changing pulmonary infiltrates OR\r\n*** Failure of antiviral therapy defined as the continued presence of pp65 antigenemia (> 1+ cell/100,000 cells) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)emia (as defined by reference lab performing polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assay but usually > 400 copies/ml) after at least 7 days of antiviral therapy OR\r\n*** Relapse after antiviral therapy defined as recurrence of either pp65 antigenemia or DNAemia after at least 2 weeks of antiviral therapy\r\n** For CMV infection, standard therapy is defined as 7 days therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir for patients with disease or recurrence after 14 days therapy\r\n** For EBV infection:\r\n*** EBV infection is defined as biopsy proven lymphoma with EBV genomes detected in tumor cells by immunocytochemistry or in situ PCR OR clinical or imaging findings consistent with EBV lymphoma and elevated EBV viral load in peripheral blood\r\n*** For EBV infection, standard therapy is defined as rituximab given at 375 mg/m^2 in patients for 1-4 doses with a CD20 positive (+) tumor\r\n*** Failure is defined as there was an increase of less than 50% response at sites of disease for EBV lymphoma OR there was a rise or a fall of less than 50% in EBV viral load in peripheral blood or any site of disease\r\n** For adenovirus infection or disease:\r\n*** Adenovirus infection is defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by PCR, DAA or culture from ONE site such as stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx OR adenovirus disease will be defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by culture from two or more sites such as stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx\r\n*** Standard therapy is defined as 7 days therapy with cidofovir (if renal function permits this agent to be given)\r\n*** Failure is defined as a rise or a fall of less than 50% in viral load in peripheral blood or any site of disease as measured by PCR or any other quantitative assay
