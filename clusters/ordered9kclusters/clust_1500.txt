[Notes: 1) Prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation as part of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy is allowed as long as therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC. 2) If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment. 3) Prior exposure to traditional medicine(s) is allowed as long as therapy was discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.]

No more than one prior systemic therapeutic regimen for unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma; this includes chemotherapy, biologic therapy, biochemotherapy, or investigational treatment; this does not include any therapies given in the adjuvant setting; however, patients are excluded if they have a history of prior treatment for melanoma (either adjuvant or metastatic disease) with ipilimumab or other cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor, or prior interferon-alpha treatment for metastatic disease (history of adjuvant interferon-alpha is allowed); there should be a 4-week washout period between last treatment administration and initiation of study therapy
Patients must not have received any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer; prior cytotoxic chemotherapy with curative intent in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting is allowed; at least 2 years must have elapsed since completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting

More than two prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., gemcitabine, doxorubicin, capecitabine) for metastatic disease.
First-line locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with no prior adjuvant chemotherapy unless the Investigator determines that one of the 4 cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in the control arm would otherwise be offered to the subject
Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer must have TNBC. Patients with advanced or metastatic disease may have received up to 2 lines of cytotoxic therapy. Adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapies are not counted in the number of lines of therapy. TNBC patients who have previously received platinum chemotherapy in the metastatic setting are allowed to enroll in the study as long as they did not progress while on or within 8 weeks from the day of the last platinum administration.
Participant has received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy (including chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy) for NSCLC, except for adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy accompanied by surgery with curative intent that was completed one year prior to Cycle 1 Day -2.
Previous hormonal therapy for metastatic breast cancer or cytotoxic adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed
Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer. Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy with curative intent in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting is allowed but must have been completed at least 6 months prior to registration. No cytotoxic chemotherapy is allowed during protocol specified therapy.
