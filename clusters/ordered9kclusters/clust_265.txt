Matched sibling, cord blood and haploidentical donors are not eligible.
Patients with pre-existing medical conditions or other factors that renders them at high risk for regimen related toxicity or ineligible for conventional myeloablative HCT and who do not have HLA-matched related or unrelated donors
Suitably HLA-matched related or unrelated donors
HEALTHY BONE MARROW DONORS: Healthy individuals, ages >= 4 years and toilet-trained, who have been identified by Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) or Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) providers as 9/10 or 10/10 (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) matched, bone marrow donors for transplantation will also be eligible to participate in this study; healthy donors may be related or unrelated to the bone marrow recipient
HLA-matched related donors >= 18 years and capable and willing to donate PBSC (Arms A and B)
DONOR: half match (haploidentical) at HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 based upon deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based typing methods; donors may be variably matched for the other allele (4/8 to 7/8), but not fully matched
Patients must have an adult donor for HCT who is adequately HLA matched by institutional standards (includes HLA-matched related or unrelated donors, and HLA-mismatched family donors, including haploidentical donors) and is either: \r\n* HLA-A*0201 positive and HA-1(H) negative (RS_1801284: G/G) or \r\n* HLA-A*0201 negative
Patients must have an adult donor for HCT who is adequately HLA matched by institutional standards (includes HLA-matched related or unrelated donors, and HLA-mismatched family donors, including haploidentical donors) and is either: \r\n** HLA-A*0201 positive and HA-1(H) negative (RS_1801284: G/G) or\r\n** HLA-A*0201 negative
DONOR: Genotypically haploidentical as determined by HLA typing\r\n* Preferably a non-maternal HLA haploidentical relative due to data of high incidence of graft failure with use of maternal HLA haploidentical cells\r\n* Eligible donors include biological parents, siblings or half-siblings, children, or cousins in rare instances
DONOR: HLA-haploidentical first-degree relatives of the patient, including biological parents, siblings, or children, or half-siblings
5/6 or 6/6 related donor match or a 7-8/8 HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 allele matched unrelated donor marrow and/or PBSC donor match per current institutional guidelines; related donors will be evaluated and collected per MT2012-14C; unrelated donors will be identified and collected per usual procedures
DONOR: Donors must match at least one allele of HLA-A, B, C, DR and DP (or permissive mismatch in the case of DP) by high resolution typing; a HLA-matched family member is ineligible to serve as a donor; eligible donors include biological parents, siblings, half-siblings or children
8/8 HLA MATCHED UNRELATED DONORS
DONOR: Genotypically haploidentical as determined by HLA typing, preferably a non-maternal HLA haploidentical relative; eligible donors include biological parents, siblings or half siblings, or children
DONOR: Donors must be HLA-haploidentical first-degree relatives of the patient; eligible donors include biological parents, siblings, or children, or half-siblings
DONOR: “High resolution” typing at HLA-A, B, C and DRB1 alleles\r\n* Single antigen mismatch for siblings and single allele mismatch for volunteer unrelated donors is acceptable\r\n* Donors must be >= 17 years of age
DONOR: Donors will be pre-selected on the basis of HLA haploidentity
DONOR: Donors must be HLA-haploidentical first-degree relatives of the patient; eligible donors include biological parents, siblings, or children, or half-siblings
Donors will be pre-selected on the basis of HLA haploidentity
Availability of HLA-matched or unrelated donors; related donors must be 5 or 6/6 antigen matched; unrelated donors must be at least 9/10 allele matched
DONOR: HLA-matched related or unrelated allogeneic donors; genotypically HLA identical twins may serve as stem cell donors; related donors must be 5 or 6/6 antigen matched; unrelated donors must be 9/10 allele matched
DONOR: Donors must be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical first-degree relatives of the patient; eligible donors include biological parents, siblings or half-siblings, or children
DONOR: HLA-matched related donors >= 18 years and capable and willing to donate PBSC
The clinical trial will be offered to all high risk (defined below) patients with hematologic malignancies who require stem cell transplants as part of their standard of care using matched related or unrelated donors
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (-A, -B, -C, -DRB1) unrelated donors; or 1-locus HLA-mismatched (-A, -B, -C, -DRB1) related or unrelated donors
DONOR: Donors must be at least HLA-haploidentical first degree relatives of the patients; eligible donors include biological parents, siblings, half-siblings or children
DONOR: Donors must be HLA-matched or one antigen or allele mismatched
DONOR: Donors must be HLA-matched or one antigen or allele mismatched
MATCHED RELATED DONOR: Donors receiving experimental therapy or investigational agents
Patients with available HLA-matched related donors
DONOR: Eligible donors include healthy sibling, relative or unrelated donors that are matched with the patient at HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 by high resolution typing
Patients must have an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible related or unrelated donor (one-antigen mismatched related donors are acceptable) willing to donate marrow or recombinant human-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [rhG-CSF] mobilized peripheral blood stem cells; in the event of transplants from matched unrelated donors, a high-resolution allele match for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 (\8 of 8 match\) is required
Must have a willing unrelated adult donor (bone marrow or peripheral blood); donors may have a single mismatch (i.e. be a 7/8) and this mismatch may be at the allele or antigen level; however, donors with allele level disparity should be given preference over those with antigen level disparity; the use of mismatched donors in which disparity is only in the host versus graft direction (because of recipient homozygosity) is discouraged because of the potentially heightened risk for graft rejection; centers may perform extended typing (e.g. DQB1 and DPB1) according to institutional practices and use these results in selecting donors; however, it is recommended that this extending typing be used only to select between donors who are equally well matched with the recipient at the A, B, C and DRB1
Eligible donors will include healthy sibling, relative or unrelated donors that are matched with the patient at HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 by high resolution typing as defined by the Collaborative Trials Network
Patients receiving allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts from HLA-matched (5/6 and 6/6 matches) siblings or from well matched unrelated donors (9/10 or 10/10 matches at HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing) are included; all grafts will be unmanipulated (i.e., no T cell depleted or CD34 selected grafts)
For patients at high risk for developing aGVHD only: Recipients of myeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic transplants using either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-matched or HLA-mismatched related or unrelated donors (protocols 9142, 9022, 9924) who have not yet been placed on any therapy for acute GVHD.
