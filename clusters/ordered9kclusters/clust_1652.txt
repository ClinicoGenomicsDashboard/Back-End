Pre-treatment laboratory tests for patients receiving fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT) must be performed within 21 days prior to baseline imaging; these laboratory tests must be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry into the study (unless not clinically relevant); 2.5 x for prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time; for those patients receiving Coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range; the initial 4.0 x value will be critical for liver function test results which can be extremely variable, and a 4.0 x above the upper normal range is still acceptable for inclusion in this study; urinalysis abnormalities will not preclude the patient from being enrolled and studied; the baseline and subsequent laboratory testing will include liver enzymes (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT], serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT], anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]), bilirubin (total), serum electrolytes, complete blood count (CBC) with platelets prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine
For the follow-up scanning sessions after therapy has been instituted and within 7 days prior to the second [18F]FLT study the laboratory assessments will be required due to the use of [18F]FLT; these studies should also be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory study (unless not clinically relevant); 2.5 x for prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time; however at the discretion of the study principal investigator (PI) the second imaging sessions can occur if laboratory values are not within the 4 X upper limit of normal (unless not clinically relevant); for those patients receiving Coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range; for the assessments at subsequent imaging time points the laboratory tests as described for baseline assessment will again be obtained
internal normalized ratio and partial thromboplastin time <1.5x upper limit of normal
