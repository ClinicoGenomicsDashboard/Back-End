If they have untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis; patients whose CNS metastases have been treated by surgery or radiotherapy, who are no longer on corticosteroids, and who are neurologically stable may be enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the trial
Known central nervous system (CNS) disease other than neurologically stable, treated brain metastases - defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage for at least 2 weeks after treatment (including brain radiotherapy). Must be off any systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of brain metastases for at least 14 days prior to enrollment.
Patients must be neurologically stable and with stable dose steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 1 week prior to obtaining the baseline MRI of the brain, and/or at least 1 week prior to beginning study treatment
Patients with treated brain metastasis as long as neurologically stable and not on steroids for at least 12 weeks
No untreated central nervous system metastases, or if treated must be neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment
Patients with a history of CNS metastases must have received therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, gamma knife) and be neurologically stable, asymptomatic, and not receiving corticosteroids for the purposes of maintaining neurologic integrity. Patients with epidural disease, canal disease and prior cord involvement are eligible if those areas have been treated, are stable, and not neurologically impaired. For patients with parenchymal CNS metastasis (or a history of CNS metastasis), baseline and subsequent radiological imaging must include evaluation of the brain (MRI preferred or CT with contrast)
CNS disease other than neurologically stable, treated brain metastases.
Untreated brain metastases. Participants must have completed treatment for brain metastasis, and be neurologically stable off steroids, for at least 28 days prior to first dose of study drug
Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases\r\n* NOTE: metastases have been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy and patients have been neurologically stable and off of steroids > 12 weeks are eligible
Subjects must be neurologically stable for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug;
Central nervous system (CNS) metastases may be permitted but must be treated and neurologically stable
Have symptomatic CNS metastases that are neurologically unstable or require an increasing dose of corticosteroids.
Patients with known brain metastases will only be eligible after their tumors have been treated with definitive resection and/or radiotherapy and they are neurologically stable for at least 1 month off steroids.
Subjects with brain metastases are eligible providing they are neurologically stable (if systemic steroids are required, subjects should be stable on the lowest clinically effective dose, as steroids as they may interfere with the activity of ipilimumab if administered at the time of the first ipilimumab dose)
Is neurologically stable without the need for steroids for ?7 days before first dose of study treatment.
Patients with brain metastases are eligible if asymptomatic and neurologically stable for at least 4 weeks and are not taking any medications contraindicated
Brain metastasis unless treated and neurologically stable
Neurologically stable
Patient with symptomatic brain metastases, ie, not neurologically stable or requiring treatment with corticosteroids, or central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.
A history of CNS involvement except as follows: Subjects with previously treated CNS metastases that are adequately treated with whole brain radiotherapy, that are neurologically stable, and do not require corticosteroids for symptomatic management for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug. There must be no clear evidence of radiographically active disease for at least 90 days prior to enrollment.
Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases will be allowed on this study. Patients may have received surgical and/or radiation treatment. The metastases must be neurologically stable, on or off corticosteroids. Patients can have low level, asymptomatic brain lesions that do not require surgical/radiation intervention acutely. Patients with symptomatic lesions with impending neurologic compromise should be appropriately treated with high dose steroids/radiation and may be re-evaluated for this study when neurologically stable.
