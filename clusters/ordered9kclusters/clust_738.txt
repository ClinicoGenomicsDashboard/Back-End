Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor
Patients who have received prior therapy with an irinotecan-based or temozolomide-based regimen are eligible; patients who have received prior therapy with a PARP inhibitor other than talazoparib are eligible; however, patients who have progressed on a PARP inhibitor plus irinotecan regimen are not eligible

Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor
Patients are not eligible who have received prior PARP inhibitors (including but not limited to veliparib, talazoparib, rucaparib, and olaparib)
TREATMENT: Patients who have had prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor in combination with temozolomide are ineligible to receive treatment with veliparib on this study; patients who have received prior temozolomide or PARP inhibitor with or without other chemotherapy/targeted agent aside from temozolomide should not be excluded solely because of receiving prior PARP inhibitor or temozolomide, unless it was in combination; patients who have received temozolomide with a PARP inhibitor in the past are eligible to participate but will not receive veliparib with temozolomide on study; such patients are eligible to receive other treatment regimens on study based on identified genetic mutations

Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib
Patients may not have previously received a PARP-inhibitor
Prior use of PARP-inhibitors
No line limit on prior therapies as long as the patient meets all other eligibility criteria; patients who have received prior PARP inhibitors and/or PI3kinase inhibitors are allowed to participate on the dose escalation portion; prior PARP inhibitors and/or PI3Kinase inhibitors excludes patients from the dose expansion cohort, but TNBC patients with BRCA mutations can go on if they had previously received a PARP inhibitor
History of grade 3 or 4 toxicities with previous PI3kinase inhibitor or PARP inhibitor exposure with the exception of hematologic toxicities
PARP inhibitor exposure:\r\n* Part A: Patients who have received prior therapy with a PARP inhibitor, with the exception of BMN 673, are eligible; however, patients who have progressed on a PARP inhibitor and temozolomide regimen are not eligible\r\n* Part B and Part C: Patients who have previously been exposed to a PARP inhibitor are not eligible
Phase 1 (Part A): patients who have progressed on a PARP inhibitor and temozolomide regimen are not eligible
Phase 2 (Part B and Part C): patients who have previously been exposed to a PARP inhibitor are not eligible
