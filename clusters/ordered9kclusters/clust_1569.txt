Diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with < 5% blasts in the bone marrow (M1) by morphology and that meets one of the following criteria:\r\n* Flow cytometric evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) (>= 0.1% leukemic blasts for ALL or < 5% leukemic blasts for AML detected in the bone marrow) OR\r\n* Molecular/cytogenetic evidence of disease (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] or polymerase chain reaction [PCR] methodology) performed within 7 days AND\r\n* With the intent of going on to an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) independent of this study
Patients must have documented hypoplasia from the bone marrow aspiration and biopsy 14 days +/- 2 days from the initiation of cytarabine treatment schedule (defined as < 5% blasts and < 20% cellularity)
Acute Leukemias: Must be in remission by morphology (< 5% blasts); Note cytogenetic relapse or persistent disease without morphologic relapse is acceptable; also a small percentage of blasts that is equivocal between marrow regeneration versus early relapse are acceptable provided there are no associated cytogenetic markers consistent with relapse
Patients with acute leukemia in morphologic complete remission with or without hematologic recovery or with myelodysplasia (MDS) with no circulating blasts and with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Patients with CMML must have a WBC count ? 10,000 cells/µL and < 5% blasts in the marrow. Patients with ? 5% blasts due to a regenerating marrow must contact the protocol chairs for review.
Subjects with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplasia must have no circulating blasts and < 5% blasts of the bone marrow.
Less than or equal to 5% blasts on bone marrow examination within 60 days of starting conditioning
EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT (PRE-TRANSPLANT): Active leukemia (> 5% leukemic blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow)
EXCLUSION CRITERIA (PRIOR TO IBRUTINIB ADMINISTRATION): Relapsed leukemia (> 5% leukemic blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow after allogeneic HCT)
Patients with acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia with no circulating blasts and with less than 10% blasts in the bone marrow
MDS\r\n* Bone marrow with =< 5 percent myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines\r\n* Peripheral blood demonstrates hemoglobin >= 11 g/dL, platelets >= 100 x 10^9/L, neutrophils >= 1 x 10^9/L, and no circulating blasts
Myelodysplasia (MDS)/myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS) – Patients must have < 5% marrow blasts at time of transplant
Acute leukemias: Must be in remission by morphology (=< 5% blasts); also a small percentage of blasts that is equivocal between marrow regeneration versus early relapse are acceptable provided there are no associated cytogenetic markers consistent with relapse
Pre-injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline bone marrow myeloblasts: a. Less than 5%: ? 100% increase to ? 8% blasts b. ? 5%: ? 50% increase to ? 10% blasts Note: ? 30% blasts is considered AML (ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIAT) per FAB (FRENCH-AMERICAN BRITISH)classification. Subjects known to have ? 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this study. RECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) nizing limitations of blast cell quantification, this protocol will allow subjects with pre-enrollment bone marrow blast counts up to 33% on the screening bone marrow examination to be considered for inclusion. Assessment may be made according to local bone marrow examination to facilitate enrollment of eligible subjects into the treatment phase of the study.
Patients with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, myeloproliferative disorder and myelodysplasia with no circulating blasts and with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow within 4 weeks of the start of transplant conditioning regimen
Patients with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplasia with no circulating blasts and with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow.
Patients must have obtained a complete remission with chemotherapy defined by the absence of circulating blasts, and less than 5% blasts on bone marrow examination following hematopoietic recovery
The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in either CP or AP. Accelerated phase will be defined as disease having 1 of the following: ?15% to <30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow; ?30% blasts + promyelocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow; ?20% basophils in peripheral blood or bone marrow; platelet count <100x109/L unrelated to therapy; or clonal evolution.
