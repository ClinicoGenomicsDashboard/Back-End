T-LGL judged by the investigator to require therapy based upon:  \r\n*Severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/microL)\r\n*Moderate neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/microL) with recurrent infections\r\n*Symptomatic or transfusion dependent anemia\r\n*Severe thrombocytopenia (< 50,000/microL)\r\n*Hepatic infiltration resulting in abnormal liver function tests\r\n*Symptomatic splenomegaly
White blood cells (WBCs) >= 2000/microL within 14 days of study registration.
Neutrophils >= 1500/microL within 14 days of study registration.
Platelets >= 100 x 10^3/microL within 14 days of study registration.
Platelet count < 50,000/microL
Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1000/microL
Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/microL (transfusion independent)
Absolute T-cell count (ATC) at screening >= 0.07 K/microL. This is defined as CD3+ T-cell percent (expressed as fraction of 100%) multiplied by the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC, expressed in K/microL).
