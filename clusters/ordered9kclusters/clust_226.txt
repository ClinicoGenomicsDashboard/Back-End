Participants with fasting blood glucose values that are > institutional ULN; in addition, patients with type 1 diabetes will also be excluded; however, patients with type 2 diabetes will be allowed if diagnosed >= 6 months prior to enrollment, and if presenting with regular hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) =< 8% at screening
