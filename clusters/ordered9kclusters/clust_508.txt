Uneqivocal evidence of a first tumor recurrence or progression on the initial treatment regimen (prior to enrollment on this study), consisting of surgical intervention (biopsy and/or resection), radiation, and temozolomide chemotherapy, as assessed by MRI or CT scan of the brain with or without contrast within 14 days prior to the start of SL-701. If receiving corticosteroids, the dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. Patients unable to undergo MRI because of non-compatible devices can be enrolled, provided CT scans are obtained and are of sufficient quality. For each patient, the same imaging technique should be performed throughout the study, for purposes of assessing tumor response or PD.
No evidence of hemorrhage on the baseline MRI or CT scan other than those that are Grade ? 1 and either post-operative or stable on at least two consecutive scans.
For patients who have undergone or will undergo stereotactic biopsy of recurrent or progressive tumor, a post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not required, provided that the pre-biopsy MRI is within 21 days of registration; if the preoperative scan is more than 21 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated; if the steroid dose is increased more than 50% between the date of biopsy and registration, a new baseline MRI is required on a stable or decreasing steroid dosage for at least 3 days even if the previous MRI was within 21 days of registration
For patients who have undergone or will undergo open resection of recurrent or progressive tumor, residual disease following resection is not mandated for eligibility into the study; to best assess the extent of residual disease post-resection, a MRI scan should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-resection period and within 21 days prior to registration; if the 96-hour scan is more than 21 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated; if the steroid dose is increased more than 50% between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI is required on a stable or decreasing steroid dosage for at least 3 days
Evidence of tumor progression by MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan following radiation therapy or following the most recent anti-tumor therapy; note: patients who have had surgical treatment at recurrence are eligible if they had a resection with measurable or non-measurable residual disease on postoperative imaging or if there is imaging evidence of disease progression as compared to the first postoperative scan
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline by CT, MRI or plain X-ray and is suitable for repeated assessment. Estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks.
Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study; to best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, an MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate postoperative period or at least 4 weeks postoperatively, within 14 days prior to registration; if the \within 96-hour of surgery\ scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated
Evidence of metastatic disease on bone scan or MRI/computed tomography (CT)
Pelvic MRI or CT (MRI preferred) evidence of radiographic T3, T4 or N1 disease
Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage on baseline MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan (except for grade 1 hemorrhage that has been stable for at least 3 months)
Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:\r\n* They are > 2 weeks from surgery\r\n* They have recovered from the effects of surgery\r\n* Evaluable or measurable disease following resection of recurrent tumor is mandated for eligibility into the study\r\n* To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, an enhanced CT/MRI should be done no later than 96 hours after surgery or it will need to be done 4-6 weeks post-operatively; if the 96 hour scan is more than 2 weeks from registration, the scan needs to be repeated
A baseline scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days otherwise a new baseline MR/CT is required; the same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement
Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI (or CT for patients who cannot tolerate MRI) in comparison to a prior scan; the same type of scan, i.e., MRI (or CT for patients who cannot undergo MRI) must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement
Residual disease of recurrent glioblastoma is not mandated for eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a post-operative MRI scan must be performed prior to registration and is recommended to be within 96 hours post-surgery (although 24-48 hours would be optimum). Note: Patients who did have surgery with a post-operative contrast-enhanced scan falling outside the 5-week window prior to registration, must have a repeat MRI scan within 14 days prior to registration.
Implanted metal or metal devices that make a MRI scan prohibitive, history of claustrophobia or other condition that would make a MRI scan prohibitive
MRI (contrast is not required but strongly recommended) of the involved spine within 4 weeks prior to registration to determine the extent of the spine involvement; an MRI is required as it is superior to a CT scan in delineating the spinal cord as well as identifying an epidural or paraspinal soft tissue component; note: if an MRI was done as a screening imaging study for eligibility, the MRI can be used as the required MRI for treatment planning
At least one tumor lesion measurable by CT or MRI scan (according to RECIST v1.1)
Inability to tolerate po; patients who have a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast dye within 7 days and/or have a pacemaker will be excluded from having a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan only
Have had an abdominal imaging test (CT, MRI, or ultrasound) within the past 7 months
All nodules should be persistent at least after three months follow up with 1 dimension (1d)-CT; a reduction up to 15% of the diameter of the largest target nodule from the previous CT scan is allowed
Measurable tumor by CT or MRI
Radiologic evidence of local recurrence or new or progressive metastatic disease demonstrated on anatomical imaging (CT, MRI, or ultrasound), whole-body bone scan (99m-Tc-MDP or Na-18F) within 4 weeks of enrollment.
Eligibility of a perfusion CT target lesion must be confirmed by the ACR Core Lab prior to study enrollment and the T0 perfusion CT scan
Any condition including, metallic implants or cardiac pacemakers that makes the candidate ineligible for MR imaging; (MRI research screening form will be completed prior to each MRI scan)
SUB-STUDY III: Imaging evidence of suspected metastatic disease, including CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound or other PET modalities
Evidence of stroke or mass lesion on CT or MRI scan
Three different adult patient groups will be eligible for inclusion in this study: \r\n* Group 1: Adult patients with compelling evidence of primary brain tumor based on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) imaging characteristics that have not yet received surgery, histological diagnosis, or any tumor-directed therapy; such evidence will include: MRI or CT scan-documented mass lesion within the brain, accompanied by anatomically appropriate neurological signs and symptoms, in the absence of a probable competing diagnosis such as brain abscess or primary intracranial hematoma\r\n* Group 2: Newly diagnosed primary malignant brain tumors (World Health Organization [WHO] grade II-IV glial-based tumors) who have not had a complete surgical resection and by contrast MRI or CT have residual tumor >= 1.0 cm in diameter and will be receiving radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy\r\n* Group 3: Patients with probable or possible recurrent primary brain tumor as determined by standard clinical criteria or MRI or CT imaging; the abnormality must be >= 1.0 cm in diameter by contrast MRI or CT or show changes on non-enhancing MRI sequences (T2 or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR])
Visible lesions by either CT, bone imaging, or MRI consistent with disease
Patients who have started radiographic evaluation and underwent CT scan and/or bone scan prior to registration to the study will be able to participate under a late registration provision, provided that the more modern scans (WB/axial MRI and F-18 NaF PET/CT) can be completed within 8 weeks after CT scan and bone scan
Patients undergoing a planning CT scan in the Department of Radiation Oncology with tumor motion assessment - planning 4-dimensional (4D)-CT ordered by the treating radiation oncologist

Measurable disease on CT scan
No findings of pancreatic disorder as documented by CT or MRI or EUS
Patients for whom the physician is able to identify suitable implantation sites for the anchored transponders on a recent (within the past 8 weeks) CT scan. This will require acquisition of a CT scan if a suitable one is not already available.
