For patients with invasive breast cancer, an axillary staging procedure must be performed (either sentinel node biopsy [SNB] alone or axillary dissection [with a minimum of six axillary nodes removed], and the axillary node[s] must be pathologically negative); patients over 70 with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumors no greater than 2 cm do not require axillary evaluation, but MUST be clinically node negative on examination and all available imaging (clinical N0)
Prior axillary dissection.
One to 5 involved lymph nodes identified at axillary staging
More than 5 involved nodes identified at axillary staging
Participants who have undergone incisional and/or excisional biopsy of primary tumor and/or axillary lymph nodes
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition stage 0 or I (Tis N0 =< 2 cm or T1 N0) histologically confirmed carcinoma of the breast, treated with partial mastectomy; axillary sampling is required only for cases of invasive cancers; tumor size is determined by the pathologist; clinical size may be used if the pathologic size is indeterminate; patients with invasive cancer must have no positive axillary lymph nodes with at least 6 axillary lymph nodes sampled or a negative sentinel node
Histologically confirmed positive axillary nodes in the ipsilateral axilla; palpable or radiographically suspicious contralateral axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes, unless there is histologic confirmation that these nodes are negative for tumor
Primary tumor =< 4 cm and 0-3 positive axillary lymph nodes (T1-2, N0-1, M0)
Pathological evidence of residual invasive carcinoma in the breast or axillary lymph nodes following completion of preoperative therapy
Participants must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer confined to the breast and regional lymphatics (supraclavicular, axillary, internal mammary lymph nodes)
Locally advanced or metastatic Her2/Neu positive breast cancer (defined as immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or a fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] ratio of >= 2.0); this may be on either a primary tumor or a metastatic site, and there is no time limit from the time the specimen was obtained; locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) includes breast cancers with advanced primary tumors, i.e., large diameter (at least 5 cm) or those with skin and/or chest wall involvement, and advanced regional lymph node involvement; it also includes a rare subgroup, inflammatory breast cancer; in the 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control (AJCC-UICC) TNM breast cancer staging system, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) includes patients with stage III disease; this comprises:\r\n* Advanced primary tumors (tumors > 5 cm in greatest dimension [T3]; direct extension to the chest wall and/or to the skin [T4]: ulceration, skin nodules, and/or edema (including peau d'orange) confined to the same breast, inflammatory breast cancer [IBC, T4d])\r\n* Advanced regional lymph nodes (ipsilateral level I, II axillary lymph nodes that are clinically fixed or matted or clinically detected internal mammary lymph nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases [N2], ipsilateral infraclavicular [level III axillary] lymph nodes, ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node[s] with axillary lymph nodes, or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes [N3])
Patients with 4 or more histologically positive axillary nodes if axillary dissection is performed
Patients must not have any palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes unless there is histologic confirmation that these nodes are negative for tumor

Patient must have a negative (normal) axillary ultrasound performed at Siteman Cancer Center; lymph nodes will be evaluated based on morphologic features; axillary ultrasound (AUS) will be considered positive (abnormal) if lymph nodes are noted to be completely hypoechoic (absent hilum) or to have focal hypoechoic cortical thickening/lobulation greater than 4 mm
