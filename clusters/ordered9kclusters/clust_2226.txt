Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
Participants must be purified protein derivative (PPD) negative; alternatively, the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay can be used; an individual is considered positive for M. tuberculosis infection if the IFN-gamma response to tuberculosis (TB) antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control); the result must be obtained within 12 weeks prior to enrollment; PPD positive (or Quantiferon assay positive) participants are permitted if prophylaxis has been completed prior to enrollment
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
Patients with known active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
Positive test for latent TB at Screening (Quantiferon test)
Patients with tuberculosis (TB). Note: Patient with latent TB may be eligible based on the investigator's benefit-risk assessment.
Patients with TB. Note: Patient with latent TB may be eligible based on the investigator's benefit-risk assessment.
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
COHORT 2: Has a known history of active TB
Have previously received TB-403
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
No active tuberculosis (TB)
active tuberculosis (history of exposure or history of positive TB test with presence of clinical symptoms, physical or radiographic finding);
Known history of current or recent clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis (within 6 months prior to enrollment). A chest x-ray (XR) will be performed to screen for active tuberculosis (TB) for patients who have a history of treated TB. A chest XR will be performed in all patients to screen for active TB unless there has been a prior chest XR or computed tomography (CT) scan of chest within 1 month of entry
Confirmed current active tuberculosis (TB)
Known tuberculosis (TB) disease or latent TB infection
All potential patients must undergo a tuberculosis (TB) test prior to study entry (either purified protein derivative [PPD] or QuantiFERON-TB Gold, whichever is preferred and available at the Institution); patients with a history of TB (even if treated), or evidence of active or latent TB, are excluded; the diagnosis of active TB is defined per current guidelines; patients with a positive TB test (e.g. PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold) will be excluded; patients with history of Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination will be tested with QuantiFERON-TB Gold test in order to rule out exposure to TB
Presence of T4b disease, precluding organ preservation
Patients with T3b, or T4, or node positive disease will be excluded as they will be considered for adjuvant hormone therapy
Quantiferon tuberculosis (TB) gold must be performed for screening for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; however, a tuberculin skin test may be placed if the Quantiferon TB gold test is indeterminate; patients must have a negative Quantiferon TB Gold (or tuberculin skin test) or evidence of appropriate treatment prior to study entry
Presence of active infection; history of exposure to TB (positive purified protein derivative [PPD] or Quantiferon TB gold) who have not been treated with a TB prophylaxis regimen for at least one month
Chest x-ray (if Quantiferon TB Gold is positive) demonstrating pleural scarring and/or calcified granuloma consistent with prior or current untreated TB
Willingness to complete tuberculosis evaluation and start prophylactic antituberculosis therapy as soon as is medically feasible if patients have a reactive tuberculin skin test and/or positive QuantiFERON-tuberculosis (TB) Gold test and have not completed an adequate course of prevented anti-tuberculosis therapy, following American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control recommended guidelines
Clinical stages T1a-T2b
Active tuberculosis (history of exposure or history of positive TB test with presence of clinical symptoms, physical or radiographic finding);
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB)
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
Negative tuberculosis (TB) testing (Quantiferon – TB blood test or skin test) =< 7 days prior to registration
Positive test for latent tuberculosis (TB) at screening (Quantiferon test) or evidence of active TB
Active tuberculosis (TB):\r\n* Patients who are undergoing first month of therapy (RIPE or equivalent) for active TB\r\n* Patients with TB immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) requiring corticosteroids\r\n** Note: patients who are receiving therapy beyond month one of initial therapy with no evidence of TB IRIS requiring corticosteroid therapy, or those receiving treatment for latent tuberculosis (INH or alternative) may be eligible after discussion with the protocol P.I.
Clinical stage ? T2b
Participants with active tuberculosis (TB) will be excluded from the clinical trial
Clinical stages T1b – T3a
Stage T3b or greater disease
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
Patients must not have intra-operative evidence of T4b disease
Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are excluded
Patients with T1 tumors on both cords (T1b)
Patients with T2b-T4 true larynx tumors
Has a known history of active TB.
Active Tuberculosis (TB)
Active tuberculosis (TB)
All patients will have a tuberculin (purified protein derivative [PPD]) skin test or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) done locally prior to the inclusion into the study. Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) will be excluded from the study.
Active TB
Active infection including tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus. Note: TB testing will be at the discretion of the treating physician and should be in line with local practice
