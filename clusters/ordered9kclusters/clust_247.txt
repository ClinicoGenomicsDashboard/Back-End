Uncontrolled systemic disease(s) such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus; blood pressure must be =< the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender
A blood pressure (BP) =< the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender for pediatric patients < 18 years old and =< 140/90 mmHg for patients >= 18 years old; patients should not be receiving medication for treatment of hypertension (except patients with Wilms tumor and RCC who may be eligible if on stable doses of no more than one anti-hypertensive medication with a baseline BP =< ULN for pediatric patients and =< 140/90 for adult patients); please note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
A blood pressure (BP) =< 95% percentile for age, height, and gender; patients on stable doses of no more than one anti-hypertensive medication, with a baseline BP =< 95% percentile for age, height, and gender will be eligible
Adequate Blood Pressure Control defined as a blood pressure (BP) <= the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender measured, subjects on stable doses of no more than one anti-hypertensive medication, with a baseline BP <= 95th percentile for age, height and gender, will be eligible.
A blood pressure (BP) =< the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender, and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension; please note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
Hypertension:\r\n* Patients, 3-17 years of age must have a blood pressure that is =< 95th percentile for age, height and gender at the time of registration\r\n** The normal blood pressure by height, age and gender tables can be accessed in the Generic Forms section of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) membersâ€™ webpage\r\n* Patients who are >= 18 years of age must have a blood pressure that is < 140/90 mm of Hg at the time of registration\r\n* Note: if a blood pressure (BP) reading prior to registration is above the 95th percentile for age, height and gender it must be rechecked and documented to be =< the 95th percentile for age, height and gender prior to patient registration
Blood pressure (BP) =< 95th percentile for age, height, and gender and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension
A blood pressure (BP) =< the 95th percentile for age, height and gender despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 days of the first dose of the study treatment; please note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure > 95th percentile for age, height and gender (systolic or diastolic) despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment
A blood pressure (BP) =< the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension
A blood pressure (BP) =< the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender measured within 7 days prior to enrollment; please note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP; patients with hypertension controlled on antihypertensive medications will be allowed if otherwise eligible
A blood pressure (BP) =< the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender measured, and not receiving medication for treatment of hypertension; please note that 3 serial blood pressures should be obtained and averaged to determine baseline BP
Hypertension must be well controlled (=< 95th percentile for age and height if patient is =< 17 years) on stable doses of medication
Patients 2-17 years of age must have a blood pressure that is ? 95th percentile for age, height and gender at the time of enrollment.
Note: If a BP reading prior to enrollment is above the 95th percentile for age, height and gender, it is to be rechecked and documented to be ? 95th percentile for age, height and gender prior to patient enrollment.
Patients with inadequately controlled systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] and/or\r\ndiastolic blood pressure [DBP] > 95th percentile for age and height)\r\n* Patients with a prior history of hypertensive crisis and/or hypertensive encephalopathy\r\nIf a blood pressure (BP) measurement prior to registration is > 95th percentile for age and height, it must be rechecked and documented to be < 95th percentile for age and height prior to registration; if a patient falls between the height or weight percentiles, site should average the value as appropriate; for patients >= 18 years, use adult normal ranges for blood pressure; patients with hypertension are eligible if their blood pressures become < 95th percentile after anti-hypertensive medications
Participants should have normal blood pressure according to age; participants 18 years of age and younger should have a blood pressure =< 95th percentile for age, height and gender, and should not be receiving medication for treatment of hypertension; preexisting hypertension in adults should be controlled (either with pharmacological or non-pharmacological methods) at the time of enrollment
BMI ? 85th percentile or waist circumference ? 85th percentile for age and gender
Patient must have blood pressure ? 95th percentile for age, height, and gender
Adequate Blood Pressure Control defined as: Blood pressure <= the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender.
Adequate blood pressure defined as:\r\n* A blood pressure (BP) =< the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender measured; adequate blood pressure can be achieved using medication for treatment of hypertension
BMI >= 50th percentile at time of study enrollment
Hypertensive patients are eligible provided the hypertension is well controlled (95th percentile for age and height if patient =< 17 years) on stable doses of medication
