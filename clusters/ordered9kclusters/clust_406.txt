Urine protein: creatinine ratio =< 1, within 14 days before the first dose of cabozantinib
Urine protein/creatinine ratio of less than 1
Urine protein to creatinine ratio =< 1 (if urine protein creatinine ratio is > 1, then a 24-hour urine total protein must be assessed; subjects will be ineligible if the 24-hour urine protein is found to be > 1 gm)
Urine protein:creatinine ratio >= 1.0 at screening
Urine protein =< 1+ or =< 30 mg/dL OR urine protein/creatinine ratio =< 1, performed within 10 days of treatment initiation
Within 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 of treatment: Urinary albumin excretion < 1.0 g/24 hours (as estimated by urine protein-creatinine ratio)
A urine protein:creatinine ratio of < 1 or < 1 g protein on 24-hour urine collection

Urine protein/creatinine ratio =< 1
PHASE I STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\r\nSpot urine protein/creatinine ratio =< 1 OR 24 hour urine protein =< 1000 mg
PHASE II COLORECTAL CANCER COHORT 6 (MEDI+C ONLY):\r\nSpot urine protein/creatinine ratio =< 1 OR 24 hour urine protein =< 1000 mg
Urine protein < 2+
Urine protein should be screened by dipstick or urine analysis; for proteinuria > 1+ or urine protein: creatinine ratio > 1.0, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be < 2000 mg for patient enrollment
Urine protein creatinine ratio as determined by urinalysis of < 0.5 (for urine protein creatinine ratio of > 0.5, 24-h urine protein must have been < 1 gram)
Urine protein:creatinine ratio >= 1.0 at screening
Urine protein : creatinine ratio >= 1.0 at screening
Urine protein =< 1+ or urine protein to creatinine ratio =< 1; if urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio is > 1 on urinalysis, then 24-hour urine collection from protein must be obtained and level must be < 1,000 mg for patient enrollment
Urine protein/creatinine ratio < 1 or 24-hour urine < 1 gram
Patients with clinically significant proteinuria (urine protein creatinine ratio greater or equal to 1.0)
Urine protein/creatinine ratio =< 1 (or protein =< 1+ on urinalysis or 24 hour urine protein =< 1 gram/24 hours)
Urine protein/creatinine ratio >= 1.0
Urine protein: creatinine ratio ? 1.0 at screening
Have persistent 2+ protein by urinalysis (patients with 2+ proteinuria that have a spot protein:creatinine ratio of less than 0.3 may be enrolled) or a history of nephrotic syndrome.
Urine protein:creatinine ratio =< 1.0 at screening
Urine protein (albumin)/creatinine ratio of < 1.0
Urine protein to creatinine ratio of < 1 prior to registration
Urine protein: creatinine ratio > 1
Within 14 days prior to registration: Urine protein/creatinine ratio should be =< 1
Urine protein:creatinine ratio of < 1
Subjects with a urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 1
Urine protein: creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 1.0
Urine protein: creatinine ratio >= 1.0 at screening
Routine urinalysis showing ?1+ protein or protein/creatinine ratio <0.5. For proteinuria ?2+ or urine protein/creatinine ratio ?0.5, 24-hour urine must be collected and the level must be <1 gram of protein in 24 hours for subject enrollment.
Urine protein:creatinine ratio =< 1.0 OR 24-hour urine protein =< 500 mg (24-hour total urine protein only need be obtained if urine protein:creatinine ratio < 1.0)
Have persistent 2+ protein by urinalysis (patients with 2+ proteinuria that have a spot protein:creatinine ratio of less than 0.3 may be enrolled) or a history of nephrotic syndrome.
Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN; if urine protein to creatinine ratio is greater than or equal to 1, a 24 hour urine protein must be assessed; subjects must have a 24 hour urine protein value less than 1 g to be eligible; use of urine dipstick for renal function assessment is not acceptable
[urine protein]/[urine creatinine]: if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/dL
[(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine]: if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L
