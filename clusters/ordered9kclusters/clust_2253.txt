LHRH agonists maybe used to render ovarian suppression with post-menopausal ranges of estradiol or FSH per institutional guidelines.

Postmenopausal, or if pre- or peri- menopausal, then will need to have concurrent ovarian suppression; pre- or peri- menopausal subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test confirmed at screening

Patients must be post-menopausal based on either a history of an oophorectomy, or at least one year of amenorrhea; an elevated serum gonadotropin level can be used to confirm menopausal status in a subject with one year or more of amenorrhea
