The patient has metastatic disease or locally recurrent, unresectable disease
Patients must not have metastatic disease (i.e., must be M0); patients must not have locally recurrent disease
Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with locally recurrent or metastatic disease; locally recurrent disease must not be amenable to any local treatment with curative intent; metastatic disease must be demonstrated either radiographically or histologically
Locally recurrent breast cancer
PROCUREMENT INCLUSION CRITERIA: Any breast cancer patient with metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable disease
Evidence of measurable, locally recurrent or metastatic disease based on imaging studies within 28 days before the first dose of study drug.
Has received at least 1, but no more than 2, prior lines of systemic therapy for locally recurrent and/or metastatic disease.
For Cohort B: No prior chemotherapy for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic or recurrent UCa and ineligible (\unfit\) for cisplatin-based chemotherapy;
More than 1 line of prior chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced/recurrent disease.
Have not received prior chemotherapy or targeted systemic therapy for their locally advanced inoperable or metastatic recurrence. Prior radiation therapy for recurrent disease is permitted
Histologically and/or cytologically documented and radiographically measurable (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or stomach (HER2-positive or negative) that is metastatic/recurrent and not amenable to potentially curative treatment (e.g., inoperable metastatic or locally recurrent disease)
Has been a participant in Study WRI-GEV-007, \A Phase I/IIa Study of SV-BR-1-GM in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer Patients\
Prior radiation or surgery to the esophagus is permitted for patients with locally recurrent/persistent disease
Metastatic and/or locally advanced or locally recurrent disease that is not surgically resectable
Locally recurrent resectable breast cancer
Histologic or cytological diagnosis of SQCLC with advanced/metastatic stage, with no known curative treatment options; prior platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease is considered first line therapy only if recurrent (local or metastatic) disease developed within 6 months of completing therapy; subjects with recurrent disease > 6 months will be eligible
Patients must have histologically-proven locally-recurrent or metastatic solid tumor; the first 10 patients may have cancer of any histology; preference will be given to patients with metastatic ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and malignant melanoma, as these malignancies have been shown to be sensitive to manipulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor; the final twenty-five patients to be accrued must have locally-recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma that is not surgically resectable
Locally recurrent/metastatic.
Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with locally recurrent, unresectable disease or metastatic disease confirmed as described below; eligible patients include those with either:\r\n* De novo metastatic disease presenting without prior history of HER2-positive breast cancer:\r\n** Diagnosis should have been made from a biopsy of a metastatic disease site, but biopsy from the breast primary or involved regional lymph nodes is acceptable if biopsy of the metastatic sites was thought to carry excessive risk for the patient\r\n* Locally recurrent or metastatic disease following prior therapy for early breast cancer:\r\n** Diagnosis must have been made from the biopsy of the locally recurrent or metastatic disease\r\n** There must be an interval of >= 6 months between completion of neoadjuvant/adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy and documentation of locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive disease by biopsy
Locally recurrent breast cancer
TNBC must be either locally recurrent or metastatic; locally recurrent disease must not be amenable to surgical resection or radiation with curative intent
Patients have locally recurrent or distant relapsed metastatic disease
Metastatic disease or incurable locally recurrent disease
Confirmed diagnosis of HR-negative, HER2-negative (locally recurrent or metastatic TNBC) breast cancer
More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for locally recurrent or metastatic TNBC. If ? 12 months have elapsed between the date of last adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration and first documented local or distant disease recurrence the therapy will not be considered a line of therapy in the locally recurrent or metastatic TNBC setting.
Locally recurrent/metastatic
Inoperable, locally recurrent or metastatic disease (tumor resectability should be assessed by a local surgeon or multidisciplinary team)
Locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable solid malignancy with measurable disease per RECIST v1.1
Participant has not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic or locally-recurrent and inoperable breast cancer
Participant has not received prior biologic therapy for metastatic or locally recurrent and inoperable breast cancer
Metastatic or locally recurrent TNBC
Solid tumor that is metastatic, locally advanced or recurrent
Locally recurrent resectable breast cancer
Patients must be untreated with chemotherapy for metastatic or locally recurrent disease; prior radiation therapy is permitted
Surgically unresectable locally recurrent disease and/or metastatic disease following RAI ablation (if locally recurrent and ultrasound (US) positive, baseline FDG-PET or MRI will be obtained).
ErbB-2 positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer
Prior systemic anti-cancer therapy other than endocrine therapy for locally recurrent or metastatic disease
Diagnosis of breast cancer with evidence of a) metastatic or b) locally recurrent/advanced disease.
Prior chemotherapy for metastatic or locally recurrent disease Exceptions:
Prior immunotherapy for metastatic or locally recurrent disease
Patient has locally recurrent or metastatic disease
Subjects who have locally recurrent or metastatic disease with at least one measurable lesion
Prior chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or investigational therapy for locally recurrent or metastatic HER2 breast cancer.
Patient has received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and /or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated to result in a durable remission.
Patient must have received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and/or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated to result in a durable remission.
Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the breast with locally recurrent or metastatic disease o Patients with breast cancer overexpressing HER2 are not eligible.
Patients must have evidence of recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic disease.
Confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with locally recurrent or metastatic disease
Locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer
Presence of residual or recurrent cancer (locally or metastatic)
Diagnosis of locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease.
Metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer
Locally recurrent or metastatic disease
