Patients with known brain metastases are not eligible; brain imaging studies are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurologic signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis; but, if brain imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease
Subjects with known or history of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease: subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a contrast CT scan or MRI of the brain within 28 days prior to randomization to exclude active brain metastasis. Imaging of the central nervous system (CNS) is otherwise not required.
Subjects with brain metastases (subjects must have a CT scan or MRI of the head within 28 days prior to enrollment to rule out brain metastases), uncontrolled seizure disorder, or active neurologic disease
The subject has current or previously treated brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease. Brain imaging is required during screening in all subjects to exclude the presence of unequivocal central nervous system disease.
History of or active CNS metastasis (brain, leptomeningeal or cord compression). Brain imaging studies are not required for eligibility if the subject has no neurologic signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis. Subjects with neurological symptoms are recommended to undergo a head CT scan (with or without intravenous contrast) or brain MRI (with or without intravenous contrast) to exclude brain metastasis. If brain imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for CNS disease. Skull bone involvement without neurological impact by prostate cancer is allowed.
Known brain or leptomeningeal disease (CT or MRI scan of the brain required only in case of clinical suspicion of central nervous system involvement).
Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects must undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain MRI within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy to exclude brain metastases if symptomatic or without prior brain imaging
Patients with known brain metastases; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastases
Known brain metastasis; participants with brain metastasis can only be included if they were treated > 4 week prior to enrollment with radiation and the effects of treatment have resolved; subjects with treated brain metastases must have a post-treatment brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing no further progression of prior lesions and no new metastatic lesions; subjects will be ineligible if they have any ongoing symptoms from brain metastases or if there continues to be radiographic evidence of cerebral edema
Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastasis; previously treated brain metastases will be allowed as long as the patient is neurologically stable and is off steroids and anticonvulsants
Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude brain metastasis; previously treated brain metastases will be allowed as long as the patient is neurologically stable and is off steroids and anticonvulsants at the time of registration
Presence of untreated brain metastases; if patients have had previous treatment for brain metastasis, an MRI or CT scan of the brain must confirm the stabilization of the brain metastasis for more than 4 weeks
Patients with brain metastases are allowed onto the study as long as patients have completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and are asymptomatic; subjects with neurological symptoms should undergo a head computed tomography (CT) scan or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to exclude brain metastasis, at the discretion of the treating physician
Known brain metastasis; patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a CT scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasis
Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded; head computed tomography (CT) is NOT routinely required prior to enrollment; patients with treated, asymptomatic brain metastasis will be eligible for enrollment
Subject has active central nervous system (CNS) metastases not controlled by prior surgery or radiotherapy (subjects must be off steroids). Subjects with signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis are not eligible unless brain metastases are ruled out by brain MRI/CT.
