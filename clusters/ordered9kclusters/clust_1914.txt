Participants must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, with locally advanced or metastatic disease; patients without pathologic confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation; for subjects in Cohort C, the tumor must also be hormone receptor positive, defined as demonstrating at least 1% tumor cell nuclei staining positive for either ER or progesterone receptor (PR)
