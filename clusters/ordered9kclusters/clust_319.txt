Patients with active 2nd malignancies other than myelofibrosis, AML, excised skin cancer, early stage cervical and prostate cancer
Patient has a history of another malignancy within 2 years prior to starting study treatment, except for excised and cured carcinoma-in-situ of breast or cervix; non-melanomatous skin cancer; T1-2, N0, M0 differentiated thyroid carcinoma either resected or under active surveillance; superficial bladder cancer; T1a or T1b prostate cancer comprising < 5% of resected tissue with normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) since resection, or status post external beam radiation or brachytherapy with normal PSA since radiation
History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:\r\n* Non-melanoma skin cancers, non-invasive bladder cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix \r\n* Prior history of prostate provided patient not under active systemic treatment other than hormonal therapy and with documented undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (< 0.2 ng/mL)\r\n* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) provided patient has isolated lymphocytosis (Rai stage 0), and does not require systemic treatment (for “B” symptoms, Richter’s transformation, lymphocyte doubling time [< 6 months], lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly)\r\n* Lymphoma or any type or hairy-cell leukemia provided patient is not on active systemic treatment and is in complete remission, as evidenced by PET/CT scans and bone marrow biopsies for at least 3 months\r\n* Papillary thyroid cancer; patients with concurrent metastatic melanoma can be enrolled; patients can be enrolled regardless of if they meet any of the following: A) have completed a thyroidectomy within the last 2 years, B) have or have not received adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy, or C) were only recently diagnosed with asymptomatic papillary thyroid cancer and their surgery is pending\r\n* History of malignancy provided patient has completed therapy and is free of disease for >= 2 years; if patient had other malignancy within the last 2 years from which he may have been completely cured by surgery alone, he may considered to be enrolled on condition that the risk of development of distant metastatic disease based on AJCC staging system is less than 30%
Malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ, or low grade prostate cancer for which watch-and-wait approach is standard of care, unless disease free for at least 3 years
An active malignancy and/or cancer history for at least 2 years with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive disease.
Any prior history of invasive malignancy within the past 5 years except non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in-situ, localized prostate cancer without biochemical recurrence following definitive treatment
