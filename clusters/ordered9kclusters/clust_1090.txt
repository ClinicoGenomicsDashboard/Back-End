Patient has a foreign body which in the opinion of the treating investigator could be difficult to manage in case of infection
The patient has a prior or concurrent malignancy that in the opinion of the investigator, presents a greater risk to the patient’s health and survival, than of the MCL, within the subsequent 6 months at the time of consent.
FOR TISSUE COLLECTION TO ESTABLISH PDX (PART 1): Reasonable expectation that the patient can wait 3-6 months for generation of data for subsequent treatment selection.
FOR PDX-GUIDED THERAPY THROUGH ONGOING TRIALS AT MD ANDERSON OR OFF-PROTOCOL WITH STANDARD OF CARE (PART 2): The patient condition remains suitable for the selected therapy. If the patient receives prior therapy with a given agent (X) and progressed, but the testing in Part 1 found this agent to be effective in a combination, the patient remains eligible for this combination that includes agent X.
THE PATIENT IS INELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PART 2 IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR: PDX data are non-informative.
THE PATIENT IS INELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PART 2 IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR: Part 1 data contradict clinical judgment. The investigator should discuss with the principal investigator (PI) and use the best discretion.
It will be at the Principal Investigator's (PIs) discretion to enroll a patient who has a small, asymptomatic brain hemorrhage, but patients who have had symptomatic hemorrhages will be excluded
Patient is premenopausal defined as either:
Patient had last menstrual period within the last 12 months or
Patient must have:
Respiratory illness requiring hospitalization at the time of step 1 registration\r\n* Note: if the respiratory illness is resolved and the patient meets the eligibility status above, then the patient can be considered for the trial
Other co-morbidity which would interfere with patient's ability to participate in trial, e.g. uncontrolled infection, uncompensated heart or lung disease
Patient must be able to swallow capsules and have no surgical or anatomic condition that will preclude the patient from swallowing and absorbing oral medications on an ongoing basis
Patients who speak English (or read one of the languages for which a translation is available must consent to complete the mandatory dysphagia-related patient reported instrument (MDADI); if the patient cannot understand spoken English and reads only languages not available in the MDADI translations, the patient can still participate in the trial, as this has been factored into the trial statistics; for all other patients, the MDADI is mandatory as it is included in the primary endpoint to be studied
Patient is allergic to 5-FC, leucovorin, or 5-FU
Patient has had prior therapy with neural stem cells
Patient must be tolerating oral intake
Patient agrees that intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates will be withheld during the first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia
Patient must not be receiving any medication that may markedly affect renal function (e.g., vancomycin, amphotericin, pentamidine)
Donors: If a patient is homozygous at a particular loci, mismatching at that loci is not allowed due to an isolated graft rejection vector, i.e., patient A*0101 and the donor is A*0101, A*0201; such a mismatch may increase the risk of graft rejection; if patient and donor pairs are both homozygous at a mismatched loci, they are considered a two-HLA antigen mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0201, and this type of mismatch is not allowed
Potential patients referred for the study may not be eligible for the experimental protocol therapy due to reasons such as uncertainty about donor HLA typing or need to control malignant disease, infection, or metabolic abnormality such as hypercalcemia on an emergent basis; should a referred patient present to us in such a scenario, the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for treatment; however, if referral back to the referring physician is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease or complicating conditions (infection, metabolic problems) under the current study; in other cases, a patient may have reasonable control of malignancy but does not meet the CD4 cell cut-off of 100 cells per microliter required for cohort 3 therapy (or, absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] value of < 300); in such cases, standard care chemotherapy regimens may be administered for the specific goal of reducing the CD4 count (that is, immune depleting regimens such as the pentostatin plus cyclophosphamide combination, administered similar to the manner that we have developed on protocol 08-C-0088); if it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to experimental therapy, then he/she must come off study; recipient-subjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol; because such standard care therapy is not experimental, it is not necessary to complete the eligibility criteria prior to receiving such standard care; however, prior to initiation of the experimental therapy, the patient must meet each of the eligibility criteria detailed above; attempts will be made to standardize such pre-transplant chemotherapy (by administration of EPOCH-FR chemotherapy); however, other regimens using approved agents will be allowed if such regimens are thought to be in the best interest of the patient

The patient has other concurrent severe medical prob-lems, unrelated to the malignancy, that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to unacceptable risk.
Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma referred for the study may not be eligible for the experimental protocol therapy due to reasons such as uncertainty about donor HLA typing or need to control malignant disease, infection, or metabolic abnormality such as hypercalcemia on an emergent basis; should a referred patient present to us in such a scenario, the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for treatment; however, if referral back to the referring physician is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease or complicating conditions (infection, metabolic problems) under the current study; if it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to experimental therapy, then he/she must come off study; recipient-subjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol; it is not necessary to complete the eligibility criteria prior to receiving such standard care; however, prior to initiation of the experimental therapy (starting with the pentostatin-cyclophosphamide [PC] regimen), the patient must meet each of the eligibility criteria
The patient's blasts cells show expression of WT1 tran-script, detected by quantitative RT-PCR.
The patient has other concurrent severe medical prob-lems, unrelated to the malignancy, that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to unacceptable risk.
