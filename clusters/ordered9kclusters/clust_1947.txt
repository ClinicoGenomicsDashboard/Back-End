Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment
Participants of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or consent to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study period. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). If a participant of childbearing potential is neither surgically sterile nor postmenopausal, highly effective contraceptive measures must start either prior to or at Screening and continue throughout the entire study period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy and at least 30 days after the last dose of Test Article (amatuximab or placebo) is administered (whichever is later). A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, the withdrawal method, condoms, and diaphragms are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must also refrain from egg cell donation for 6 months after the final dose of investigational product.
Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for women within 7 days of receiving the first dose of the study medication for women of childbearing potential; women will be considered not of childbearing potential and exempt from pregnancy testing if they are either a) older than 50 and amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, or b) have documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy, but not tubal ligation
Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration for protocol therapy; patients are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months
All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing)
Patients must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or of child-bearing potential. Patients are considered not of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for greater than 12 months (if patient is uncertain of amenorrhea for 12 months, a pregnancy test will be done to confirm pregnancy status). Patients in whom ovaries are present and were not previously menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum estradiol <10 pm/mL to confirm ovarian senescence.
Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours (hrs) prior to treatment; NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile, have a congenital acquired condition that prevents childbearing (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 weeks prior to screening) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months without an alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy; in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement is insufficient
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing and to practice contraception; females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months
