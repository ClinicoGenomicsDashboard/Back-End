Organ dysfunction\r\n* Cardiac ejection fraction < 35% (or, if unable to obtain ejection fraction, shortening fraction of < 26%); ejection fraction is required if age > 50 years or there is a history of anthracycline exposure or history of cardiac disease; patients with a shortening fraction < 26% may be enrolled if approved by a cardiologist\r\n* Pulmonary: \r\n** Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) < 40%, total lung capacity (TLC) < 40%, forced expiratory volume in the first second of breath (FEV1) < 40% and/or receiving supplementary continuous oxygen\r\n** The FHCRC PI of the study must approve of enrollment of all patients with pulmonary nodules
Organ dysfunction as defined by the following:\r\n* Symptomatic coronary artery disease or cardiac ejection fraction < 35% (or, if unable to obtain ejection fraction, shortening fraction of < 26%); if shortening fraction is < 26% a cardiology consult is required with the principal investigator (PI) having final approval of eligibility; ejection fraction is required if age > 50 years or there is a history of anthracycline exposure or history of cardiac disease\r\n* Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) < 35%, TLC < 35%, forced expiratory volume (FEV)1 < 35% and/or receiving supplementary continuous oxygen; the FHCRC PI of the study must approve of enrollment of all patients with pulmonary nodules\r\n* Liver function abnormalities: Patient with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease will be evaluated for the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, bridging fibrosis, and the degree of portal hypertension; the patient will be excluded if he/she is found to have fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension, alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a history of bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction evinced by prolongation of the prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension, bacterial or fungal liver abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic viral hepatitis with total serum bilirubin > 3mg/dL, or symptomatic biliary disease
Significant organ dysfunction that would prevent compliance with conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis, or would severely limit the probability of survival:\r\n * 1) Symptomatic coronary artery disease or ejection fraction < 35% or other cardiac failure requiring therapy (or, if unable to obtain ejection fraction, shortening fraction of < 26%); if shortening fraction is < 26% a cardiology consult is required with the principal investigator (PI) having final approval of eligibility\r\n * 2) Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) < 40% total lung capacity (TLC) < 40%, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 40% and/or receiving supplementary continuous oxygen; the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) study PI must approve enrollment of all patients with pulmonary nodules\r\n * 3) Liver function abnormalities: patient with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease will be evaluated for the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, bridging fibrosis, and the degree of portal hypertension; the patient will be excluded if he/she is found to have fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension, alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a history of bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction evinced by prolongation of the prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension, bacterial or fungal liver abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic viral hepatitis with total serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL, or symptomatic biliary disease
