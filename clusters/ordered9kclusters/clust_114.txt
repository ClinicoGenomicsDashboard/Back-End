At least one prior treatment for metastatic disease
Any metastatic disease
Patients with prior surgical resection who develop radiological or clinical evidence of metastatic cancer do not require separate histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic disease unless an interval of > 5 years has elapsed between the primary surgery and the development of metastatic disease; clinicians should consider biopsy of lesions to establish diagnosis of metastatic disease if there is substantial clinical ambiguity regarding the nature or source of apparent metastases
