If a patient has had an OctreoScan® performed while Octreotide LAR treatment-naïve, the patient must have a repeat OctreoScan® performed after 3 months of Octreotide LAR treatments before entering the clinical study to prove that the index lesions or new lesions still meet the criteria for inclusion.
