No currently active other malignancies which require systemic treatment
Patients with previous malignancies that have been treated with systemic chemotherapy with alkylator or anthracycline therapy. The latter group of patients are excluded due to an expected increase in late effects (eg. late cardiac toxicity, secondary malignancies, sterility, etc.).
Subjects with any of the following solid malignancies:
Have other active malignancies or diagnosed with other malignancies within the last 6 months, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
Have prior malignancies. Participants with carcinoma in situ of any origin and participants with prior malignancies who are in remission and whose likelihood of recurrence is very low, as judged by the Lilly clinical research physician, are eligible for this study.
Patients with other active malignancies are ineligible for this study, other than localized malignancies
Other active malignancies.
Research participants with any other active malignancies
Other malignancies requiring active treatment in the last 6 months
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation or hormonal therapy, with the exception of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation or hormonal therapy, with the exception of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin
Natural Killer cell malignancies
Natural killer cell malignancies
Concurrent, clinically significant, active malignancies within 12 months of study enrollment
Any concurrent active malignancies, defined as malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation, since adverse events resulting from these malignancies or their treatment may confound our assessment of the safety of adoptive T cell therapy for ovarian cancer
Patients with a history of other malignancies, except:
Patients with multiple malignancies remain eligible
Research participants with any other active malignancies
Patients with other active malignancies are ineligible for this study, other than localized malignancies
Other active malignancy (other than malignancies, which the investigator determines are unlikely to interfere with treatment and safety analysis)
Concurrent malignancies
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation
Have other active malignancies or diagnosed with other malignancies within the last 6 months, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation
Natural killer cell malignancies
Natural killer cell malignancies
Other untreated coexisting HIV related malignancies.
Other concomitant active malignancies
History of other active malignancies.
EXCLUSION FOR COLLECTION OF T CELLS/PBMCS: Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation
EXCLUSION FOR TREATMENT: Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation
Patients with other active malignancies (no evidence of other cancer or life expectancy greater than 5 years) are ineligible for this study
Known other active malignancy (other than malignancies which the investigator determines are unlikely to interfere with treatment and safety analysis)
Patients with other malignancies or brain metastasis are not eligible; however, given the frequent coexistence of MCC with other malignancies, the following exceptions are allowed:
Other active malignancies
Other malignancies requiring active therapy or known to be associated with altered immune response
Previous malignancies
Patients with active (uncontrolled, metastatic) second malignancies are excluded.
Relapsed disease or development of other malignancies
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation, with the exception of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin
Most concurrent second malignancies
Concurrent, clinically significant, active malignancies within two years of study enrollment.
History of any other active malignancies
Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation
History of other malignancies, except:
History of other malignancies, except
Other active malignancies
Subjects may not have other active malignancies other than indolent malignancies not requiring active therapy which the investigator determines are unlikely to interfere with treatment and safety analysis
Patients with other active malignancies (no evidence of other cancer or life expectancy greater than 5 years) are ineligible for this study
Other concurrent malignancies except skin cancer
All gastrointestinal malignancies where the patient received oxaliplatin for cancer treatment or breast malignancies where patients have received docetaxel or paclitaxel for cancer treatment
Patients with a new suspected or confirmed gynecologic malignancies
Natural Killer Cell Malignancies
Prior malignancies.
Patient with salivary gland malignancies
Relapsed or progressive advanced malignancies (solid tumors or hematologic malignancies)
