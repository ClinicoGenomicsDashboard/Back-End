Patients with pre-existing significant central nervous system pathology that would preclude treatment with blinatumomab, including: history of severe brain injury, dementia, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, psychosis, coordination/movement disorder, or autoimmune disease with CNS involvement are not eligible; patients with a history of cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage with residual deficits are not eligible; (patients with a history of cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage remain eligible provided all neurologic deficits have resolved)
CNS disorder such as cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or autoimmune disease with CNS involvement that in the judgment of the investigator may impair the ability to evaluate neurotoxicity
EXCLUSION - TREATMENT: Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities: presence of CNS-3 disease defined as detectable cerebrospinal blast cells in a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with ? 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per mm^3; history or presence of any CNS disorder such as a seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement
History or presence of any CNS disorder such as a seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement
History of seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement
CNS disorder such as cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement that in the judgment of the investigator may impair the ability to evaluate neurotoxicity
History or presence of non-malignant CNS disorder such as seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement
History or presence of CNS disorder such as seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement
History of a seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement
