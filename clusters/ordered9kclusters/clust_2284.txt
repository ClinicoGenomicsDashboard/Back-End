Patients without HLA-A1, or HLA-A*02, or HLA-A*24 restriction.
Subjects must be HLA-A2 positive
HLA phenotype positive. Note: Patients who were previously HLA-typed for participation in other Immatics' sponsored clinical trials and were HLA phenotype positive may enter IMA202-101 main screening

Subject must be HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 positive.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 (HLA-A2.1) positivity by molecular subtyping\r\n* Patients with HLA-A*0205 (HLA-A2.5) positivity by molecular subtyping may be eligible if there is demonstration that they can correctly present the MART-1 26-35 epitope as stimulators for interferon (IFN)-gamma production by MART-1 F5 TCR transgenic cells
