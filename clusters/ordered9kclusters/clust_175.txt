RECIPIENTS
RECIPIENTS:
Confirmed PDGFRA amplification in the tumor tissue at the time of diagnosis or time of recurrence. Central confirmation of PDGFRA amplification will be performed by FISH in CLIA certified lab (ProPath). Signal quantitation will be used to generate a PDGFRA/centromere 4 ratio. PDGFRA to Centromere 4 ratios will be interpreted as follows: 1.8 to 2.2, borderline for amplification; 2.2 to 5.0, low-level amplification; and greater than 5.0 or clustered signals that are too numerous to count would be considered highly amplified. Tumor samples with PDGFRA to Centromere 4 ratios of 2.2 or higher will be considered amplified and therefore eligible for this trial. For patients with local CLIA testing demonstrating PDGFRA amplification by Next Generation Sequencing (Foundation Medicine, CMS400), central testing will not be required.

DONOR: Selection of two CB units is allowed to provide sufficient cell dose (see below for algorithm to determine single versus double unit transplant); when multiple units are selected, the following rules apply:\r\n* The CB unit with the least HLA disparity (with the patient) will be selected first (i.e., selection priority is 6/6 match > 5/6 match > 4/6 match); additional CB units then may be selected to achieve the required cell dose, as outlined below; if a second unit is required, this unit will be the unit that most closely HLA matches the patient and meets minimum size criteria outlined below of at least 1.5 x 10^7 total nucleated cells (TNC)/kg (i.e. a smaller, more closely matched unit will be selected over a larger, less well matched unit as long as minimum criteria are met)\r\n* If two CB units are used:\r\n** The total cell dose of the combined units must be at least 3.0 x 10^7 TNC per kilogram recipient weight\r\n** Each CB unit MUST contain at least 1.5 x 10^7 TNC per kilogram recipient weight\r\n* Algorithm for determining single versus double unit cord blood transplant:\r\n** Match grade 6/6: TNC dose >= 2.5 x 10^7/kg\r\n** Match grade 5/6, 4/6: TNC dose >= 4.0 (+/- 0.5) x 10^7/kg

JC virus: Treatment of progressive or persistent JC virus infection or disease without suitable alternative treatment option; pepmixes specific for antigens on adenovirus, EBV, CMV, HHV6 and BK virus are used to generate multivirus-specific VSTs; no pepmix specific for the rare JC virus is used for generation of these cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), however given the high homology (> 90%) between JC and BK and the fact that BK virus-specific T cells targeting polyomavirus capsid protein (VP1) and large T (as targeted in multivirus VSTs) have been administered to treat JCV-progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), resulting in viral clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid it is likely that VSTs are efficacious against JC virus; given the current lack of treatment options for JC virus infection or reactivation after HSCT and the risk of progression to PML, which is almost uniformly fatal, and the apparent activity of BK virus-directed T cells against JC virus infected cells, this trial proposes including patients with progressive or persistent JC virus on this study, unless a suitable alternative therapy is available\r\n* JC virus infection is defined as the presence of elevated JC virus levels as detected by PCR or positive culture in one site such as CSF or blood\r\n* JC virus disease is defined as defined as the presence of JC virus detectable by culture or PCR in one or more sites such as blood or CSF and symptoms of disease including symptoms of PML OR detectable JC virus by PCR or culture in more than one site

A diagnosis of CD established by referring physician(s) and confirmed by our review of the clinical presentation, clinical course, endoscopic and imaging findings, and histology of mucosal tissue specimens
An adverse prognosis, documented by persistent signs and symptoms of CD that have failed to respond satisfactorily to medical and surgical therapies in the past, including but not limited to systemic immune suppressive drugs and biopharmaceuticals; to be considered as refractory to medical and surgical therapy, there must be clinical, endoscopic, and histologic evidence of active inflammatory Crohn's Disease that has either persisted or recurred despite exhaustive treatment with available pharmaceutical and surgical therapies; exhaustive treatment is defined as prior exposure to the following, without durable improvement:\r\n* Systemic glucocorticoids at or above a prednisone equivalent of 40 mg/day for at least 2 weeks, or until drug toxicity or intolerance develops\r\n* Methotrexate (25 mg per week for at least 3 months, or until drug toxicity or intolerance develops) and/or a thiopurine antimetabolite (either 2.5 mg/kg azathioprine or 1.5 mg/kg 6-mercaptopurine in patients homozygous wild-type for the thiopurine-S-methyltransferase [TPMT] gene, or either 1.5 mg/kg azathioprine or 1 mg/kg 6-mercaptopurine in patients heterozygous for TPMT, or doses of these drugs capable of producing a 6-thioguanine nucleotide level of 230-400 without producing a 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotide level above 5700 for at least 3 months, or until drug allergy, intolerance or toxicity develops); if a patient is homozygous mutant for the TPMT gene, thiopurines would be contraindicated and their use would not be a requirement for enrollment in this protocol\r\n* Use of at least two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapies, that is, infliximab (at least 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for at least 3 months, or until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance or anti-infliximab antibodies develop) and/or adalimumab (at least 40 mg subcutaneously [SQ] every 2 weeks for at least 3 months, or until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance develops) and/or certolizumab pegol (at least 400 mg SQ every 4 weeks for at least 3 months, or until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance develops)\r\n* Due to the serious risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and the reluctance of some patients to agree to therapy that carries such risk, prior exposure to natalizumab is not required to meet the definition of exhaustive pharmaceutical treatment; neither will use of natalizumab among patients who are John Cunningham (JC) virus antibody seronegative be an exclusionary criterion\r\n* Exhaustive surgical treatment will be defined as indicated operations for complications of Crohn's Disease up to the point where the risks of surgery (for example, mortality or post-operative morbidity such as short bowel syndrome or extensive adhesions with high risk for inadvertent enterotomy) are deemed by patients and their physicians to be unacceptably high; indicated operations for complications of Crohn's Disease include, but are not limited to, surgical resection of involved intestine, stricturoplasty, drainage, curettage, or adhesiolysis of tissues affected by Crohn's disease\r\n* Exposure of patients to investigational drug therapies for Crohn's Disease, that is, to drugs that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this indication, will not be a criterion for either inclusion or exclusion
