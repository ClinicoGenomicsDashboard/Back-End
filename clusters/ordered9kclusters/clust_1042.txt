Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 x IULN, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ?2.5 x ULN for the institution, alkaline phosphatase ? 2.5 x ULN for the institution, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Patients with any elevated alkaline phosphatase due to bone metastasis can be enrolled
Adequate liver function as demonstrated by: Total bilirubin of ?1.5 mg/dL or ?2.0 mg/dL for subjects with liver metastasis, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ?3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ?5 x ULN if liver metastasis is present, Alkaline phosphatase ?3 x ULN or ?5 x ULN if bone or liver metastasis is present, Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) <10 x ULN
Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 x upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present (< 5 x upper limit of normal) in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 X ULN, unless bone metastasis is present (< 5 X ULN) in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 x the ULN, there is no upper limit if bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 x ULN, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 X upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Obtained within 28 days prior to registration: Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal, unless bone or liver metastasis is present (=< 5 x upper limit of normal)
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal unless bone metastasis are present in the absence of liver metastases
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 X upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 X upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 times the upper limit of normal in the absence of liver metastasis; alkaline phosphatase < 5.0 times ULN in the presence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 times upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase ?2.0 x ULN or ?5 x ULN in case of bone metastasis and/or hepatic metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 x ULN; if bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis then =< 5 x ULN
Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (in subjects with no liver metastasis and < 5.0 upper limit of normal [ULN] in subjects with liver metastasis)
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 X upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis in present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 X upper limit of normal in the absence of liver or bone metastasis, or =< 5.0 x upper limit of normal range if bone or liver metastases
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 x ULN (unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis, in which case 3.0 x ULN would be acceptable)
Alkaline phosphatase =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (< 5 X ULN for subjects with bone or liver metastasis)
Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
Adequate liver function as demonstrated by:Total bilirubin of ?1.5 mg/dL or ?2.0 mg/dL for subjects with liver metastasis, Alanine aminotransferase ?3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ?5 x ULN if liver metastasis is present, Alkaline phosphatase ?3 x ULN or ?5 x ULN if bone or liver metastasis is present
