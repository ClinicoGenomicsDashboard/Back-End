Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease; subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll
Subjects with active autoimmune disease, symptoms or conditions; subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only requiring hormone replacement, asymptomatic laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease (e.g.: +antinuclear antibody [ANA], +rheumatoid factor [RF], antithyroglobulin antibodies), or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll
NOTE: patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event)
For Arms L (pembrolizumab) and M (nivolumab), subjects with an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease; subjects with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll
Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease that requires systemic treatment (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs); Note: Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment; subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger
Subjects must not have a known or suspected history of an autoimmune disorder, including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Wegner syndrome, Hashimoto syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, or autoimmune hepatitis, within 3 years of the first dose of investigational agent, except for the following. a. Subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders such as vitiligo, or alopecia not requiring systemic therapy, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are eligible.
Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll).
Has active, or suspected autoimmune disease or a history of known autoimmune disease, with the exception of: o Participants with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition requiring only hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger.
