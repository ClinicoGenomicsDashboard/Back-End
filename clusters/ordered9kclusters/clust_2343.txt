Histologically documented HER2-positive and HER2-negative (cohort E only) breast cancer
Histologically confirmed triple negative breast cancer that are refractory, intolerant, or ineligible to receive approved standard therapies
Have a diagnosis of metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) • Up to 1-2 prior lines of chemotherapy
Histopathological diagnosis of metastatic or inoperable locally advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that meets the following criteria:\r\n* Triple negative is generally defined as estrogen receptor (ER) < 1%, progesterone receptor (PR) < 1%, and HER2 negative according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines by local testing according to institutional standards\r\n** Note: for tumors with equivocal interpretation of receptor status (e.g., ER/PR >= 1% “weak” or “faint” staining), the principal investigator will have final determination of triple-negative status; for tumors with discrepant receptor results between 2 or more biopsies (including metastatic and/or early stage biopsies), the principal investigator will have final determination of triple negative status, but in general the most recent biopsy can be used for eligibility purposes; if receptor testing is not available on a metastatic biopsy, the primary tumor test result is acceptable\r\n* Metastatic or inoperable locally advanced disease is defined as either: histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer by biopsy; or locally advanced breast cancer that, in the opinion of the treating physician, is not amenable to curative intent surgical resection; or, radiological or clinical evidence suggestive and supportive of metastatic disease without a documented metastatic biopsy, provided the patient has a prior diagnosis of TNBC that otherwise meets the eligibility criteria\r\n* Ductal, lobular, mixed, or metaplastic histology

Diagnosis of triple-negative or ER-negative breast cancer
HER2/neu positive or estrogen and progesterone receptor negative breast cancer; patients with triple negative breast cancer are also excluded
At least 10 HER2-negative breast cancer patients will be enrolled in this cohort
Women already undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat their primary triple negative breast cancer
Histological documentation of advanced solid tumor, other than triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Cohort 1: Participants must have triple negative breast cancer.
Patients enrolled on the expansion portion of the study will consist of two cohorts: those patients who are triple-negative, BRCA-mutant positive and those patients who have triple-negative, non-BRCA mutated breast cancer
triple-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) defined as histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer and must have received at least 1 chemotherapy-containing regimen for advanced disease (recurrent or metastatic). Tumour must be triple-negative, defined as minimal or no expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors [<10% of cells positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC)], and minimal or no expression of HER2 (IHC staining 0 or 1+ or FISH-).
