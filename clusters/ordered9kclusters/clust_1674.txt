Evidence of intratumoral or peritumoral hemorrhage on baseline MRI scan other than those that are grade =< 1 and either post-operative or stable on at least 2 consecutive MRI scans
All subjects must have MRI scans of the brain within 28 days prior to registration; an MRI of the spine should be performed if clinically indicated
Clinical evidence of extra-capsular extension on scans.

Must be willing and able to undergo three research PET scans
Must be willing and able to undergo two research MRI scans, one before study treatment begins and another shortly after SBRT
Must be able and willing to undergo two MRI scans, before study treatment begins and shortly after first dose of radiation (only mandatory for first 10 patients who have no contra-indications for MRI
Unable to undergo MRI scans (e.g., embedded ferromagnetic metal or pacemakers)
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain and spine must be completed within 14 days of patient registration; all MRI scans should be with and without gadolinium
All patients who do not have surgery performed must have MRI scans obtained prior to induction
Patients unable to undergo MR imaging because of non-compatible devices can be enrolled, provided CT scans are obtained and are of sufficient quality; patients without non-compatible devices may not have CT scans performed to meet this requirement
Radiographic stability should be determined by comparing contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans at screening to scans obtained by the same method at least 4 weeks earlier
Participants must be willing and able to undergo regular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain

Patients must be able to tolerate MRI scans
Patients must be able to undergo contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (or contrast enhanced computed tomography [CT] scans for patients unable to tolerate MRI)
Able to undergo brain MRI scans
Has evidence of intratumoral or peritumoral hemorrhage on baseline MRI scan other than those that are ?Grade 1 and either post-operative or stable on at least 2 consecutive MRI scans

Patients who require sedation prior to MRI scans
Radiographic confirmation of MBO is required prior to registration; scans may have been done before or after admission; scans done prior to admission must have been completed within 14 days prior to admission; computed tomography (CT) scans are preferred
Participants must show evidence of disease progression within 12 months (an additional month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates of performance of screening scans, ie, within ?13 months) prior to signing informed consent, according to RECIST 1.1 assessed and confirmed by central radiographic review of CT and/or MRI scans.
