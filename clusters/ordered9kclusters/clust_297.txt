Free of symptoms of uncontrolled cardiac disease including unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia; the ejection fraction by gated cardiac blood flow scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram must be > 40%
Absence of decompensated congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled arrhythmia and left ventricular ejection fraction > 40%; for children that are not able to cooperate with multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) and echocardiography, such should be clearly stated in the physician’s note
Absence of decompensated congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled arrhythmia and left ventricular ejection fraction >= 40%; for children that are not able to cooperate with multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) and echocardiography, such should be clearly stated in the physician’s note
Absence of decompensated congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled arrhythmia and left ventricular ejection fraction >= 35%
Adequate cardiac function defined as absence of decompensated congestive heart failure or uncontrolled arrhythmia AND left ventricular ejection fraction >= 35% OR fractional shortening > 22%
