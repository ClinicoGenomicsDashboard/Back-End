PHASE II STUDY COHORT 5 TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (MEDI+O ONLY):\r\nPatients with evidence of CNS metastasis, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal disease within six months prior to enrollment will be excluded from this clinical trial; patients with a remote history of brain metastases may be considered if they received sterilizing therapy to the CNS (resection or radiation) and have been CNS progression free for the six months period; baseline imaging to rule out brain metastases is not required for screening, but should be performed prior to study enrollment if clinically indicated; patients with spinal cord compression may be considered if the condition is medically managed and currently asymptomatic
PHASE II STUDY METASTATIC CASTRATE-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER COHORT 4 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (MEDI+O ONLY):\r\nPatients with evidence of CNS metastasis, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal disease within 1 year prior to enrollment will be excluded from this clinical trial; patients with a remote history of brain metastases may be considered if they received sterilizing therapy to the CNS (resection or radiation) and have been CNS progression-free for the 1-year period; baseline imaging to rule out brain metastases is not required for screening, but should be performed prior to study enrollment if clinically indicated; patients with spinal cord compression may be considered if the condition is medically managed and currently asymptomatic
Have symptomatic leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or spinal cord compression. Patients with asymptomatic leptomeningeal disease and no evidence of spinal cord compression are allowed.
