Patients may not have a known or confirmed history of pneumonitis
Evidence of current pneumonitis
Participants with evidence of pneumonitis on scans at screening will be excluded
Patients excluded with any prior treatment of pneumonitis requiring corticosteroids.
Pneumonitis and history of pneumonitis.

History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years
History of pneumonitis
Prior history of radiation pneumonitis
Known prior history of interstitial pneumonitis, including clinically significant radiation pneumonitis (i.e. affecting activities of daily living or requiring therapeutic intervention)
History of pneumonitis or active lung infection
History of pneumonitis
A history of drug-induced pneumonitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis from prior ALK TKI therapy
Pneumonitis within the last 5 years
History of or ongoing drug-induced pneumonitis
Patients with active pneumonitis TREATMENT SCREENING:
Active pneumonitis
Active or prior history of pneumonitis that required corticosteroids
Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis; history of radiation pneumonitis is allowed provided that it is not active and no corticosteroids were required for pneumonitis management
Patients with active sepsis or pneumonitis
Known history or ongoing diagnosis of pneumonitis
Patient has documented pneumonitis which is active and requiring treatment
History of acute pneumonitis.
Presence of active pneumonitis
Pneumonitis that requires oral or IV steroids;
Current pneumonitis or history of pneumonitis requiring steroids
Ongoing drug-induced pneumonitis
Have a history or the presence at baseline of pulmonary interstitial disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis.
Participant has history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR a history of pneumonitis that has required oral or IV steroids. Participants whose pneumonitis was solely as a result of radiation therapy for their NSCLC would not be excluded from the study unless they received oral/IV steroids to manage the pneumonitis.
Subjects with pneumonitis or at risk of pneumonitis;
History of drug-induced pneumonitis
Ongoing drug-induced pneumonitis
History of pneumonitis attributed to an EGFR inhibitor; history of radiation pneumonitis is allowed provided steroid administration for pneumonitis was not required
