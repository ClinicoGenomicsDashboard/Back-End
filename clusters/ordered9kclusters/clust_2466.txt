Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception for 30 days plus (+) 5 half-lives (60 days) of the study drugs; for a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required; highly effective birth control in this study is defined as a double barrier method; examples include a condom (with spermicide) in combination with a diaphragm, cervical cap, or intrauterine device (IUD); the individual methods of contraception should be determined in consultation with the investigator
Males and females of childbearing potential are permitted in the study so long as they consent to avoid getting their partner pregnant or becoming pregnant, respectively, by using a highly effective contraception method, as described below, throughout the study and for up to 90 days after completion. Highly effective methods of contraception include: intra-uterine device (nonhormonal or hormonal), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomy, sexual abstinence, or barrier methods (e.g., condom, diaphragm) used in combination with hormonal methods associated with inhibition of ovulation. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ? 1 year. Women who have documentation of at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and have an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL will be considered postmenopausal.
