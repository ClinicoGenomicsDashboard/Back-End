Poorly controlled hypertension despite anti-hypertensive medications
Patients who are currently receiving more than one anti-hypertensive medication (Grade 3) or whose blood pressure is not well controlled are not eligible for study enrollment.
Patients who are receiving anti-hypertensive medications for control of blood pressure at the time of enrollment are not eligible for this trial
Uncontrolled or ongoing/active infection; patients with the following history will also not be eligible for the trial: patients with a recent history of hemorrhage or hemoptysis; patients with dehiscence or wound healing complications requiring medical intervention; patients with severe hypertension that cannot be controlled (blood pressure of > 150 systolic or > 100 diastolic mmHg) with anti-hypertensive therapy within 7 days of first dose of therapy
Hypertension requiring 3 or more anti-hypertensive medications to control
Have uncontrolled hypertension; subjects with a history of hypertension are permitted in the study provided their blood pressure is controlled by anti-hypertensive therapy
A requirement for a calcium channel blocker for blood pressure control that cannot be switched to an antihypertensive with an alternative mechanism of action; permitted anti-hypertensive medications include: chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, nadolol, enalapril, lisinopril, eprosartan, and irbesartan
Patients who are receiving anti-hypertensive medications for control of blood pressure at the time of enrollment are not eligible for this trial
Poorly controlled hypertension despite anti-hypertensive medications
Hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure.
Uncontrolled symptomatic hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive agents
History of hypertension not well-controlled (>= 160/90) even though on a regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy
No patients with inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as a blood pressure of >= 150 mmHg systolic and/or >= 90 mmHg diastolic), or any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy
Patients with a history of hypertension should be well controlled (< 140/90 mmHg) on a regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy
Inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of > 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure > 100 mmHg on anti-hypertensive medications); Note: history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy not allowed
Patients with a history of hypertension must be well-controlled (< 150/90) on a regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy
Patients with inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as a blood pressure of > 150 mmHg systolic and/or > 100 mmHg diastolic on medication), or any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy
Uncontrolled hypertension (home blood pressure readings are permitted) or prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy; however, treatment of hypertension with medications is permitted
Patients receiving anti-hypertensive medicines must be on a stable regimen for at least 1 month
History of hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy
Patients with poorly controlled hypertension despite hypertensive medication
Patients who have persistently elevated systolic blood pressures (BPs) >= 145 or diastolic BPs >= 90 need to have their systolic or diastolic BP controlled with anti-hypertensive agents for at least 3 days prior to the initiation of cell therapy; patients already on anti-hypertensive agents will have their medicine adjusted based on the clinical judgment of the patient care team
Patients with a history of hypertension must be well-controlled (< 150 systolic/< 100 diastolic) on a stable regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy
Recent initiation (within 6-months) of anti-hypertensive medication (individuals on stable therapy may be enrolled)
Patients must not be receiving anti-hypertensive medications at time of study entry.
Hypertensive medication should be initiated or increased for optimal blood pressure control according to standard public health guidelines prior to starting the ketogenic diet
Hypertensive medication should be initiated or increased for optimal blood pressure control according to standard public health guidelines prior to starting the ketogenic diet
Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmHg on antihypertensive medications), any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy, and history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study enrollment
Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as requiring changes in any hypertensive regimen within 1 week of study entry) or patients diagnosed with hypertension based on repeat blood pressure measurements of > 160/90 mmHg at screening
Blood pressure <=Grade 1 (hypertensive participants are permitted if their blood pressure is controlled to <=Grade 1 by hypertensive medications.
Blood pressure ?Grade 1 (hypertensive participants are permitted if their blood pressure is controlled to ? Grade 1 by hypertensive medications and glycosylated hemoglobin is ?6.5%).
History of hypertension that is not well-controlled (>= 160/90) on anti-hypertensive therapy
Currently taking anti-hypertensive medications
Hypertensive-level readings over three weeks, with at least two of three elevated blood pressure (BP) readings (systolic >= 140 and/or diastolic >= 90); OR one hypertensive crisis reading (systolic >= 165 and/or diastolic >= 100) (eligible for the study without having to return for second or third readings) OR have a known diagnosis of hypertension and have elevated values at one reading (eligible for the study without having to return for second or third readings)
