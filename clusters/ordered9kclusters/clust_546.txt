Invasive breast cancer is estrogen receptor (ER) positive with an Allred score of 6, 7 or 8 by local institution standard protocol; if an Allred score is not reported on the diagnostic pathology report, ER positivity in > 66% cells is eligible; if ER positivity is =< 66%, the staining intensity (weak, intermediate, strong) is needed to calculate the Allred score to determine eligibility
Tumor ER Allred score between 0-5 or HER2 positive by IHC (3+) or amplified by FISH > 2.0
Patients must have histologically confirmed estrogen receptor (ER)-, progesterone receptor (PR)- and HER2-negative (triple-negative, TNBC) or ER, PR, and HER2 equivocal status and must not have received and not be planning to receive adjuvant anti-HER2 or endocrine therapies after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy; patients who are HER2 positive by American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines are ineligible; HER2 negative and HER2 equivocal cases as per ASCO CAP guidelines that do not receive HER2-targeted therapy are eligible; patients with weekly ER or PR positive disease, defined as ER and/or PR < 5% by immunohistochemistry, are eligible if the treating physician considers the patient not eligible for adjuvant endocrine therapy; residual disease must be >= 1 cm in greatest dimension, and/or have positive lymph nodes (ypN+) observed on pathologic exam\r\n* NOTE: Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-positive isolated tumor cells in the lymph node (N0 [i+]) are not considered node-positive and these patients also must have >= 1 cm residual invasive cancer in the breast in order to be eligible

Local testing on the diagnostic core must have determined the tumor to be ER-negative, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative by current ASCO/CAP guidelines. (If local testing has determined a tumor to be HER2 equivocal or to have a borderline ER/PgR status (% IHC staining < 10% for both) and other eligibility criteria are met, material may be submitted for central testing to determine eligibility.)
Central testing for ER, PgR, and HER2 will be performed, and the tumor must be determined to be ER-negative, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative by current ASCO/CAP Guidelines Recommendations. Material from either the diagnostic core biopsy or the research biopsy can be used for central testing depending on local preferences and standards.
Patients with synchronous bilateral or multicentric HER2-negative breast cancer are eligible as long as the highest risk tumor is ER-negative and PgR-negative and meets stage eligibility criteria. All of the other invasive tumors must also be HER2-negative by ASCO/CAP Guidelines based on local testing. Central testing to confirm TNBC status is only required for the highest risk tumor.
