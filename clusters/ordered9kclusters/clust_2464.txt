Clinically significant coagulation disorder
All patients should have normal coagulation, with international normalized ratio (INR) < 1.3 and able to withhold anti-coagulation medications a minimum of 24 hours prior to radiosurgery (or until INR normalizes), on the day of treatment and 24 hours after radiosurgery has concluded; those patients getting WBRT may continue these medications

Patients on therapeutic dose anti-coagulation with warfarin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or other anti-coagulants will be allowed to participate in the study; however, the anti-coagulants should be held pre- and post- research biopsy (when applicable) as per institutional standards; the risks of a temporary hold of anti-coagulation should be carefully considered and explained to the patient as part of the informed consent process; if it is not felt to be in the best interest of the patient to have anti-coagulation held, the patient may still enter the study, but should not undergo a research biopsy
