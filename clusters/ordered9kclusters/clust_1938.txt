Hemoglobin >= 10 gm/dl; eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion
Hemoglobin >= 8.0 gm/dL; transfusion permitted to achieve this level
Hemoglobin >= 9 gm/dL before starting therapy; eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion
Hemoglobin level >= 9 g/dL
Participants with hemoglobin level >= 8 g/dL, within 21 days of initiation of protocol therapy; transfusion may be used to meet hemoglobin eligibility criteria
Participants with hemoglobin level < 8 g/dL, within 21 days of initiation of protocol therapy; transfusion may be used to meet hemoglobin eligibility criteria
Performed within 14 days (+ 3 working days) prior to registration: Hemoglobin > 10 gm/dl (may be reached by transfusion).
Hemoglobin (Hgb) >= 10 g/dL; eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion, within 14 day prior to registration
Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL (may transfuse or use erythropoietin to achieve this level)
Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dl (eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion)
Hemoglobin >= 10 gm/dl; eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion
Hemoglobin >= 10 gm/dL (performed within 14 days prior to registration); eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion
patients who have a minimum hemoglobin level of 9
Hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.
Hemoglobin level < 8.0 g/dL
Within 14 days of subject registration: Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL (which may be reached by transfusion)
Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL (which may be reached by transfusion)
Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dl (may be reached by transfusion)
Hemoglobin level >= 11.0 g/dl
Participants with hemoglobin level < 8 g/dL, within 21 days of initiation of protocol therapy; transfusion may be used to meet hemoglobin eligibility criteria
Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dl (may be reached by transfusion)
Performed within 14 days of patient registration: Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL(which may be reached by transfusion)
Patient must have a hemoglobin >= 9 gm/dl (this may be achieved by transfusion if needed) obtained within 14 days before registration; if a patient receives packed red blood cell transfusion to achieve a hemoglobin level of >= 9 gm/dl, the hemoglobin level needs to be stable (no drop by more than 1 gm/dl from the post-transfusion hemoglobin level) for at least 1 week
Participants with hemoglobin level < 8.0 g/dL, at time of screening; transfusion may not be used to meet eligibility criteria within 7 days of obtaining screening evaluation
Baseline hemoglobin level of > 7.0 g/dl
Hemoglobin > 10 gm/dl; eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion
At least 4 weeks (28 days) prior to registration: Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL (which may be reached by transfusion)
Participants with hemoglobin level < 8.0 g/dL, at time of screening; transfusion may not be used to meet eligibility criteria within 7 days of obtaining screening evaluation
Hemoglobin >= 10 gm/dl; eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion
Hemoglobin >= 10 gm/dl (may be reached by transfusion)
Hemoglobin >= 9.0 g/dl (may be reached by transfusion)
Hemoglobin >= 9 g/dL (transfusion to this level is allowed)
Hemoglobin >= 10 gm/dl (eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion)
The hemoglobin level must be greater than 9 g/dL; low hemoglobin counts may be corrected with transfusion to achieve eligibility for study
Hemoglobin >= 10.0 g/dL; note: this level may be reached by transfusion
Patients must have documented hemoglobin level of 10g/dL or higher
Hemoglobin >= 9 mg/dl (NOTE: eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion)
Hemoglobin level of at least 10 g/dL (transfusion is allowed to achieve hemoglobin level of at least 10 g/dL).
Hemoglobin level of >= 9 g/dL
Hemoglobin of >=10 g/dl within 2 weeks of enrollment; if the patient has not had blood drawn for a hemoglobin level in the past two weeks, one will be done to determine the eligibility
Hemoglobin of >= 10 g/dl within 2 weeks of enrollment; if the patient has not had blood drawn for a hemoglobin level in the past two weeks, one will be done to determine the eligibility
A hemoglobin level < 10g/dl
Have a hemoglobin level of >= 10 g/dL within 2 weeks of enrollment
Hemoglobin level of >= 8 g/dL within 2 weeks of enrollment; if the patient has not had blood drawn for a hemoglobin level in the previous two weeks, one will be performed to determine eligibility; patients with a hemoglobin level < 9g/dL will be referred for treatment of anemia
Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion
