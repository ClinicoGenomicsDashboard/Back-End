History or presence of atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; the presence or history of ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia), which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3), symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation despite treatment, or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; patients with atrial fibrillation controlled by medication are permitted
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia), which is symptomatic or requires treatment (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 3), symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation despite treatment, or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; patients with atrial fibrillation controlled by medication are permitted
Presence of any of the following on electrocardiogram (ECG):\r\n* Atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and flutter\r\n* Atrioventricular (AV) block\r\n* Heart rate < 60 beats/minute unless the participant is otherwise eligible, without significant cardiac concerns and approval is obtained by the protocol chair/study cardiologist prior to enrollment\r\n* Heart rate > 100 beats/minute\r\n* Ventricular fibrillation\r\n* Ventricular tachycardia\r\n* Premature ventricular contractions\r\n* Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\r\n* NOTE: any questions on cardiac eligibility should be reviewed by the Study Cardiologist for approval in advance of enrollment
Patient must not have ongoing ventricular cardiac dysrhythmias of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4 grade > 2; patients with a history of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or ventricular fibrillation [VF] > 3 beats in a row) are also excluded; additionally, patients with ongoing atrial fibrillation are not eligible
Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. Exception: Participants with controlled atrial fibrillation for >30 days prior to study treatment initiation are eligible.
Requirement for inotropic support (excluding digoxin), or serious (uncontrolled) cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia);
History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. This does not include asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate.
Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: presyncope or syncope of either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. Exception: Participants with controlled atrial fibrillation for >30 days prior to study treatment are eligible.
Participants with a history of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, left bundle branch block) that is symptomatic or requires treatment (except for controlled atrial fibrillation)
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions PVCs), bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3) or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; atrial fibrillation, controlled on medication, is not excluded
Patients with a history of arrhythmia or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia are not eligible. Patients with atrial fibrillation with well-controlled ventricular rate on medication, are eligible.
Significant ventricular arrhythmias (> 20 premature ventricular contractions [PVCs]/min due to gating difficulty) atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled ventricular response
History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions [PVCs], bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation), which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3) or asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia; atrial fibrillation, controlled on medication is not excluded
Cardiac dysrhythmia that is potentially life-threatening, such as ventricular tachycardia, multifocal premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular tachycardias with a rapid ventricular response; well-controlled atrial fibrillation or rare (< 2 minute) premature ventricular contractions are not exclusionary
Atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled ventricular response
Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest. Exception: subjects with controlled atrial fibrillation for >30 days prior to study treatment are eligible.
