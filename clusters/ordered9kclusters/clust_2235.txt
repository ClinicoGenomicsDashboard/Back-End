A diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis.
Subject has BCR-ABL-positive leukemia (Chronic myeloid leukemia [CML] in blast crisis).
Patients with myeloid diseases (AML, myeloid blast crisis of CML) will be eligible for arm A with cytarabine; patients with lymphoid diseases (ALL, lymphoid blast crisis of CML) will be eligible for arm B with liposomal vincristine; patients with leukemia of ambiguous lineage or bi-phenotypic leukemia (e.g. B/myeloid) may be treated on either arm A or B, at discretion of treating physician
Myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment
CML in blast crisis
Myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment
Myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for CML-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment (excluding sorafenib)
CML in blast crisis
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in refractory blast crisis
Patients who are in blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); prior MDS or CMML is acceptable
Newly diagnosed or relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in second chronic phase after accelerated or blast crisis; blast crisis defined as:\r\n* Blast count >= 20% in the peripheral blood or bone marrow\r\n* Large foci of blasts on bone marrow\r\n* Presence of extra-medullary blastic infiltrate (myeloid sarcoma or chloroma)
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which:\r\n* Failed to achieve a cytogenetic remission to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment or has a cytogenetic relapse\r\n* Has ever been in accelerated phase or blast crisis
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in refractory blast crisis
CML in blast crisis
Myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment
BCR-ABL1 chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC)
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in refractory blast crisis
Patients who are in the blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia
Myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment
Previous diagnosis of accelerated phase or blast crisis
Blast phase CML
Prior imatinib failure or had accelerated phase or blast crisis CML
Patients with APL (FAB type M3) or CML in blast crisis.
Refractory/relapsing blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Refractory/relapsing myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment
Relapsed AML, ALL, CML in blast crisis, or MDS
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis
Previous diagnosis of CML accelerated phase or blast crisis
The patient has lymphoid Ph+ blast crisis or blast phase CML.
