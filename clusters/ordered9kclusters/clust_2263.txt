Subject has current central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases or history of CNS or leptomeningeal metastases.
Leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Known leptomeningeal or brainstem metastases. The presence of leptomeningeal enhancement alone, without associated clinical manifestations and/or positive CSF cytology, will not be constituted as known leptomeningeal metastases
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Metastases detected below the tentorium or beyond the cranial vault, including tumors with evidence of leptomeningeal metastases as previously indicated;
Presence of leptomeningeal metastases
Diffuse Leptomeningeal metastases with radiographic involvement in the brain and/or spinal cord. This does not include local leptomeningeal involvement which is defined as leptomeningeal enhancement within direct contact of targetable metastases
Participants must not have active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Subjects with leptomeningeal metastases in lumbar area.
History of leptomeningeal metastases
Active leptomeningeal metastases
Patients with leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Must not have leptomeningeal metastases.
Leptomeningeal metastases
Participants in Part F must have HR+ breast cancer, NSCLC, or melanoma with leptomeningeal metastases.
For Parts A, B, C, D, E: Have evidence of leptomeningeal metastases. Note: discrete dural metastases are permitted.
Evidence of leptomeningeal metastases
Participant has known leptomeningeal metastases.
Patients with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Evidence of leptomeningeal metastases
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are not allowed.
Active CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease.
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease requiring immediate treatment with radiation therapy or steroids.
Subjects with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Patients with known or suspected leptomeningeal metastases.
Known leptomeningeal metastases not amenable to radiotherapy; patients receiving radiotherapy for leptomeningeal metastases are eligible
Brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease or bone metastases
Known leptomeningeal metastases
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are not allowed
History of leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases or brain metastases except as for Inclusion Criterion #6.
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Active metastases.
Those with leptomeningeal metastases as the only site of CNS disease
Patients with leptomeningeal metastases
Symptomatic CNS metastases or evidence of leptomeningeal disease.
Active metastases.
Known brain metastases (unless asymptomatic and treated) or leptomeningeal metastases, including suspected leptomeningeal spread with positive cytology
Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Presence of leptomeningeal disease or dural metastases.
Leptomeningeal metastases, hemorrhagic metastases, presence of midline shift; please note: leptomeningeal metastases may be allowed if it is limited to cranial metastasis (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] spine should be completed, within 4 weeks of enrollment, to show that no other leptomeningeal metastases is present) and is not the only metastasis present in the brain
Evidence of CNS or leptomeningeal metastases
History of leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases
Subjects with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases
Patients with definitive leptomeningeal metastases
Leptomeningeal metastases; please note: leptomeningeal metastases may be allowed if it is limited to cranial metastasis (MRI spine should be completed, within 4 weeks of enrollment, to show that no other leptomeningeal metastases is present) and is not the only metastasis present in the brain
History of leptomeningeal metastases
Has active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.
