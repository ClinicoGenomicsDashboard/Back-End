Diagnosis and staging of de novo acute GvHD of the GIT (any site except isolated “upper” GIT disease);\r\n* Patients must be classifief as \high risk\ by the combined Minnesota (MN)/Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant (CIBMTR) grading\r\n* Biopsies should be obtained by full endoscopy including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy; however, it is not necessary to have confirmation of GvHD diagnosis before initiating IASA therapy; such is not recommended\r\n* If other diagnoses are excluded, it is not necessary to biopsy all potentially involved sites in the GIT to initiate therapy\r\n* It is possible that other diagnoses may be present as well, and this should not exclude eligibility so long as they are distinct (this statement is generic, but applies especially to various types of infective colitis; that said, concomitant anti-infective therapy must be on-going)\r\n* Although this study is designed for patient with high-risk de novo, acute GvHD of the lower gastrointestinal tract, selected patients with more advanced, even “steroid refractory” acute GvHD may be considered for this study providing they fulfill two criteria: 1) have no history of prior IASA; and 2) are personally approved by the principal investigator (PI), or in his absence, his designee

Patients may not be receiving any other drugs for the treatment of GvHD or investigational agents, except for a maximum of 48 hours of prior GC therapy, as above (obviously, this requirement is waived for SA – acute GvHD patients; in this case, no requirements are mandated)
