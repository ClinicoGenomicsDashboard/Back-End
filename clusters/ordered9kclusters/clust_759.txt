FOR SECOND-LINE THERAPY ONLY: Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must be =< 2 X the upper limit of the institution's normal range and INR (international normalized ratio) < 2; subjects on anticoagulation (such as coumadin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator
International normalized ratio (INR) < 2, at the time of enrollment; subjects on anticoagulation (such as coumadin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must be =< 1.5 x upper normal limit of institution's normal range and INR (international normalized ratio) < 1.5; subjects on anticoagulant (such as warfarin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator
Patients on anticoagulant therapy with unstable dose of warfarin and/or having an out-of- therapeutic range international normalized ratio (INR) (> 3) within the 4 weeks prior to drug administration
Coagulation: INR < 1.5 times normal, aPTT < 1.5 times normal. Patients receiving therapeutic doses of anticoagulant therapy may be considered eligible for the trial if INR and aPTT are within the acceptable therapeutic limits for the institution.
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must be =< 1.5 X upper normal limit of institution's normal range and INR (international normalized ratio) =< 1.5; subjects on anticoagulant (such as coumadin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator; alternate anticoagulation should be considered
International normalized ratio (INR) < 1.5; subjects on anticoagulant (such as Coumadin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator
International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5; subjects on anticoagulant (such as Coumadin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator
International normalized ratio (INR) 0.8 to upper limit of normal (ULN) or ? 3 for subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy such as Coumadin or heparin
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must be =< 2 X upper normal limit of institution's normal range and INR (international normalized ratio) < 2; subjects on anticoagulant (such as Coumadin) must have a PTT =< 5 X upper normal limit of institution's normal range and INR (international normalized ratio) < 5
International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal unless patient is receiving anticoagulants; if patient is on anticoagulation therapy, levels should be within therapeutic range
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must be =< 1.5 X upper normal limit of institution's normal range and international normalized ratio (INR) < 1.5; subjects on anticoagulant (such as Coumadin) will be permitted to enroll as long as the INR is in the acceptable therapeutic range as determined by the investigator
