Visceral metastasis (excluding liver metastases) and/or lymphadenopathy
Presence of skeletal, and/or soft-tissue/visceral/nodal metastasis
have visceral crisis
No current evidence of visceral crisis or lymphangitic spread
No visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread or known brain metastases: visceral crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases, but implies severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory studies, and rapid progression of disease

Visceral (ie, liver or lung) metastases as only sites of metastases
Contraindications to angiography and selective visceral catheterization
Presence of unstable systemic disease (e.g., visceral crisis or rapid progression) in the judgment of the investigator
Have visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
Patients with extensive advanced/metastatic, symptomatic visceral disease, or known uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases
Pending visceral crisis, in the opinion of the treating investigator
Visceral (eg, lung, liver) metastatic disease. Adenopathy is allowed;
Has rapid progression of visceral disease and, thus is a candidate for docetaxel; this determination will be at the discretion of the treating physician
A visceral metastasis greater than 8 cm
A visceral metastasis that due to its location cannot be safely treated with SABR
Have visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis visceral crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases but implies severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory studies, and rapid progression of the disease
History of visceral metastasis, or presence of visceral metastasis detected by screening imaging examinations
