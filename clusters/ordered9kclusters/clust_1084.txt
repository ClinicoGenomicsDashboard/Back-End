Investigator feels participation is not in the best interest of the subject.
Acuity of surgical needs: Subjects with acute neurologic compromise, symptoms of impending cerebral herniation, or other condition(s) necessitating urgent or emergent neurosurgical intervention to be planned within 2 hours not eligible. NOTE: If subject is enrolled on study, receives study medication and subsequently condition worsens such that urgent surgical intervention is felt to be in best interest of subject, best interest of subject should always take precedence over timing between study medication and surgery
Subject at risk of airway compromise in the event of postinjection tumor swelling/inflammation based on investigator judgment.
Any subject for whom the investigator feels participation is not in the best interest of the subject.
Any subject for whom the investigator feels participation is not in the best interest of the subject.
In France, a subject will not be eligible when under legal protection.
