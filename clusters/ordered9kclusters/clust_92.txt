Participant has cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class >
Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease which subjects are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or angina pain. Class 3 is defined as cardiac disease which subjects are comfortable at rest but less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. Class 4 is defined as cardiac disease which subjects have an inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, symptoms of heart failure at rest, and if any physical activity is undertaken then discomfort increases.
Class II or greater New York Heart Association Functional Classification criteria or serious cardiac arrhythmias likely to increase the risk of cardiac complications of cytokine therapy (e.g. ventricular tachycardia, frequent ventricular ectopy, or supraventricular tachyarrhythmia requiring chronic therapy)
A cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association class >= 2
Patients must have no clinical signs of heart failure and meet New York Heart Association functional classification I or II defined as:\r\n* Class I – patients with no limitation of activities; they suffer no symptoms from ordinary activities\r\n* Class II – patients with slight, mild limitation of activity; they are comfortable with rest or with mild exertion
Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or worse (marked limitation of physical activity; comfortable at rest; less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea)
Class II or greater New York Heart Association Functional Classification criteria or serious cardiac arrhythmias likely to increase the risk of cardiac complications of cytokine therapy (e.g. ventricular tachycardia, frequent ventricular ectopy, or supraventricular tachyarrhythmia requiring chronic therapy)
A cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class ? 2, defined as cardiac disease in which patients are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or angina pain
Class II or greater congestive heart failure as described in the New York Heart Association Functional Classification criteria or serious arrhythmias likely to increase the risk of cardiac complications of cytokine therapy (e.g. ventricular tachycardia, frequent ventricular ectopy, or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring chronic therapy)
Class II or greater New York Heart Association Functional Classification criteria or serious cardiac arrhythmias likely to increase the risk of cardiac complications of cytokine therapy (e.g. ventricular tachycardia, frequent ventricular ectopy, or supraventricular tachyarrhythmia requiring chronic therapy)
American Heart Association class I: patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical activity; ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain; additionally, patients > 60 years of age must have a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least >= 40% demonstrated by multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram (Echo)
Congestive cardiac failure of >= Grade 3 severity according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification defined as subjects with marked limitation of activity and who are comfortable only at rest.
Patients with New York Heart Association Class II or greater congestive heart failure (Class II is defined as symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea or other symptoms with ordinary physical activity)
A cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association class >= 2, defined as cardiac disease in which patients are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or angina pain
Class III or Class IV myocardial disease as described by the New York Heart Association; a recent history (within 6 months) of myocardial infarction, or symptomatic arrhythmia at the time of randomization. Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Such patients are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity that causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.
Participant has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater than 2.
A cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class >/=3. Class 3 is defined as cardiac disease in which participants are comfortable at rest but have marked limitation of physical activity due to fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or anginal pain
