Patients must have a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder confirmed at the study institution. The patient must have demonstrated nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer refractory or recurrent to standard intravesical therapy. Refractory disease is defined as failure to achieve tumor-free status by 6 months of initiation of adequate BCG therapy. Recurrent disease is defined as reappearance of disease after achieving a tumor-free status by 6 months of initiation of adequate BCG therapy. Adequate BCG therapy includes at least 6 weeks induction plus 3 additional doses of either induction or maintenance. Patients with a history of other intravesical agents (except nab-rapamycin or gemcitabine) in addition to standard BCG will also be allowed to enroll. All grossly visible disease must be fully resected and pathologic stage will be confirmed at the institution where the patient is enrolled. This will include stage Ta, T1, Tis and exclude all patients with muscle invasion (T2).
Documented BCG-refractory disease defined as failure to achieve a tumor free state after at least 2 prior induction courses of intravesical BCG therapy; NOTE: For patients with residual non-invasive tumors (i.e. Ta, T1, Tis) after an initial 6-week induction course of intravesical BCG therapy, a second induction course of intravesical BCG therapy is required; patients with persistent non-invasive tumors (i.e. Ta, T1, Tis) despite an initial 6-week and second induction intravesical BCG therapy course are considered BCG-refractory and, therefore, eligible for study; patients with non-invasive tumor recurrences (i.e. Ta, T1, Tis) after only an initial 6-week induction course of intravesical BCG therapy are considered BCG-resistant and not eligible for study until persistent non-invasive tumor (i.e. Ta, T1, Tis) is demonstrated after a second induction course of intravesical BCG therapy has been administered; there is no maximum limit on the number of prior BCG therapy courses; in addition, there is no maximum limit on the number of prior non-BCG intravesical therapy courses (i.e. gemcitabine, valrubicin, interferon, mitomycin C, etc.)

Previous intolerance to BCG intravesical therapy suggested by development of systemic BCG infection in the past and/or grade 4 or greater adverse effect by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0
Are \BCG Unresponsive\ which refers to patients with high-grade NMIBC who are unlikely to benefit from and who will not receiving further intravesical BCG. The term \BCG unresponsive\ includes patients who did not respond to BCG treatment and have a persistent high-grade recurrence within 12 months after BCG was initiated, and those who despite an initial complete response (CR) to BCG, relapse with high-grade CIS within 12 months of their last intravesical treatment with BCG or relapse with high-grade Ta/T1 NMIBC within 6 months of their last intravesical treatment with BCG. The following criteria define the patients who may be included in the study:
Have received at least 2 previous courses of BCG within a 12 month period - defined as at least 5 of 6 induction BCG instillations and at least 2 out of 3 instillations of maintenance BCG, or at least two of six instillations of a second induction course, where maintenance BCG is not given
Exception: those who have T1 high-grade disease at first evaluation after induction BCG alone (at least 5 of 6 doses) may qualify in the absence of disease progression
At the time of tumor recurrence, patients with CIS alone or high-grade Ta/T1 with CIS should be within 12 months of last exposure to BCG and patients with Ta/T1 without CIS should be within 6 months of last exposure to BCG
No maximum limit to the amount of BCG administered
previous intravesical BCG therapy, which can be given at least 5 weeks before the diagnostic biopsy required for entry into the study
Subjects must have received adequate BCG treatment defined as at least 2 courses of BCG, i.e., at least one induction and one maintenance course or at least 2 induction courses. The initial induction course must be at least 5 treatments within a 7-week period. The second course (induction or maintenance) must be at least 2 treatments within a 6-week period. The \5+2\ doses of BCG must be given within approximately 1 year (i.e., the start of one course to start of the second course within 12 months ±1 month) and for the same disease episode for which the subject is enrolling. Treatment must be considered \full-dose\ BCG (see Section 10). If additional doses or courses of BCG above the minimum \5+2\ are given, these do not have to be within the same approximate 12 month timeframe. Subjects who were unable to receive at least 5 doses of BCG in a first course and at least 2 doses of BCG in a second course due to intolerance are not eligible. Subjects who began their initial course of BCG with \full-dose\ BCG and required dose-reductions due to adverse events but are still able to tolerate at least \5+2\ doses of BCG are considered to meet the requirement for \adequate BCG.\ Subjects who received less than \full dose\ BCG (e.g., 1/3rd dosing) as a standard regimen and not due to dose reductions because of AEs are not eligible. The BCG may have been given in combination with interferon. When BCG is given simultaneously in combination with interferon, 1/3rd dosing of BCG is acceptable.
The subject's disease is refractory or has relapsed following adequate BCG treatment. Refractory disease is defined as disease which persists at the first evaluation following adequate BCG. Relapsed disease is defined as having a complete response to adequate BCG but recurs at a subsequent evaluation. Subjects will enroll into one of three cohorts based on their type of disease and the time to refractory/relapsed disease following their last dose of BCG as follows:
Cohort 1: Subjects with CIS with or without associated papillary disease whose disease is determined to be refractory or relapsed within 6 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment.
Cohort 2: Subjects with CIS with or without associated papillary disease whose disease is determined to be refractory or relapsed more than 6 months but within 11 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment.
Patients must have received at least two or more prior courses of intravesical therapy per recommended schedules. BCG must have been one of the prior therapies administered.
Patients can have either failed BCG induction therapy within a six-month period or have been successfully treated with BCG, but subsequently found to have recurrence. The first standard course of intravesical BCG therapy must include at least six weekly treatments (allowable range of instillations per course is 4-9). The second course of BCG therapy must include at least two weekly treatments.
