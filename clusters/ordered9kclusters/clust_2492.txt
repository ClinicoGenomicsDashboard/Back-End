Urine M-protein ? 200 mg/24 h
Urinary protein < 2+ (unless total quantitative protein is < 500 mg protein/day as determined by 24 hour [H] urine collection)
Spot urine must not show 1+ or more protein in urine or the patient will require a repeat urinalysis; if repeat urinalysis shows 1+ protein or more, a 24-hour urine collection will be required and must show total protein excretion < 1000 mg/24 hours
Patients must have a 24 hour (hr) urine collection showing less than 2000 mg of protein; EXCEPTION: patients with hematuria will be eligible with up to 3000 mg protein per 24 hours provided they do not have casts, eosinophiluria or electrolyte wasting
Spot urine must not show 1+ or more protein in urine or the subject will require a repeat urinalysis. If repeat urinalysis shows 1+ protein or more, a 24-hour urine collection will be required and must show total protein excretion <1,000 mg per 24 hours.
Participants with urine protein ?1 gram/24 hour
Urine protein < 1+; if >= 1+, 24 hour urine protein should be obtained and should be < 1000 mg
Significant proteinuria: urinary protein/creatinine ratio >0.5 mg/mg in a non first void urine sample
Either urine protein < 1+ or measured 24 hour urine protein < 500 milligram
Continued from Inclusion #8: Serum creatinine </= 1.5 ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) >/= 45 mL/min (CrCl = Wt (kg) x (140-age)/72 x Cr level, female x 0.85) for pts w/ creatinine levels above institutional normal; Amylase & lipase < 1.5 x the ULN; Urinalysis (UA) must show less than 1+ protein in urine, or the pt will require a repeat UA. If repeat UA shows 1+ protein or more, a 24 hour urine collection will be required & must show total protein </= 1000 mg/24 hour to be eligible
