Patient must have an adequate supply of stem cells for transplant harvested prior to study enrollment, with adequate supply defined as 3 x 10^6 cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cells/kg for peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC); cell mobilization method will be left up to the treating physician's discretion and may include mobilization growth factor alone or mobilization after chemotherapy; if patient is unable to mobilize the proper amount of peripheral stem cells, bone marrow may be harvested as the source of hematopoietic stem cells; in this instance, 3 x 10^8 mononuclear cells/kg will be considered adequate; if necessary, a combination of peripheral stem cells and bone marrow can be used

No more than 1 antigen mismatch at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 or -DQB1 locus for unrelated donor with peripheral blood and bone marrow as the hematopoietic stem cell source; and
DONOR: Donors >= 18 years of age must be the same individual whose cells were used as the source for the patientâ€™s original stem cell transplant
Marrow is the preferred source of stem cells from the HLA-haploidentical donor, however, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) could be used as stem cell source, after clearance with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) principal investigator, in the case of difficulties or contraindications to bone marrow harvest from the donor
DONOR: Marrow is the preferred source of stem cells from the HLA-haploidentical donor, however PBMC could be used as stem cell source, after clearance with the FHCRC principal investigator, in the case of difficulties or contraindications to bone marrow harvest from the donor
