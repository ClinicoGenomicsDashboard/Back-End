Males who self-identify as having had or currently having sex with men; both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects are being enrolled
Men with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or prior anal disease will be included given their increased risk for current disease
HIV positive; documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one of the following:\r\n* Documentation of HIV diagnosis in the medical record by a licensed health care provider;\r\n* Documentation of receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by a licensed health care provider (documentation may be a record of an ART prescription in the participant’s medical record, a written prescription in the name of the participant for ART, or pill bottles for ART with a label showing the participant’s name; receipt of at least two agents is required; each component agent of a multi-class combination ART regimen will be counted toward the 2-agent requirement, excepting receipt of a pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] regimen alone [e.g., Truvada], which is exclusionary);\r\n* HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay demonstrating > 1000 RNA copies/mL;\r\n* Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 western blot confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay\r\n* NOTE: A “licensed” assay refers to a United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved assay, which is required for all investigational new drug (IND) studies
Participants with a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Note: an HIV screening test does not have to be performed to evaluate this criterion
Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Note: An HIV screening test does not have to be performed to evaluate this criterion
No human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease (patients with immune dysfunction are at a significantly higher risk of infection from intensive immunosuppressive therapies)
Documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, genital warts, chancroid, or pelvic inflammatory disease that will require long term treatment
Acquired immunosuppressive diseases such as active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or congenital diseases of immunity
HIV-1 infection as documented by any federally approved, licensed HIV test performed in conjunction with screening (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], Western blot or other approved test); alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has documented that the patient has HIV based on prior ELISA and western blot, or other approved diagnostic tests; if the participant’s HIV status is documented by an outside physician, the protocol team strongly recommends obtaining a copy of the HIV laboratory reports from this physician; all confirmatory tests and the physician’s note must be on file before the participant is enrolled; in the rare circumstance where only an outside physician’s note with no supporting laboratory documentation is available, the local site should have additional tests performed to verify the participant’s HIV status; one of the following additional tests should be performed:\r\n* A rapid HIV test\r\n* ELISA and Western blot\r\n* Chemiluminescence immunoassay and Western blot\r\n* HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) > 2000 copies/mL\r\n* HIV antigen test
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients due to the previous toxicity noted with [18F] FLT in this patient group
Patients who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive will be excluded as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HIV itself are known to cause peripheral neuropathy
Patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory EBV-associated or KSHV-associated malignancies including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lymphomas are potentially eligible
The patient is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The effect of BPM31510 on HIV medications is unknown. Note: HIV testing is not required for eligibility, but if performed previously and was positive, the patient is ineligible for the study.
