Patient must have at least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by radiological evaluation (ultrasound, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography [CT], PET) or physical examination\r\n* Patients with evaluable osseous metastasis that are lytic or mixed lytic-sclerotic are eligible\r\n* Patients with hepatic lesions may be eligible provided the location of the lesion is peripheral or not too close to hepatic duct; decision on hepatic lesion eligibility will be made by the principal investigator or sub-investigator after careful review of all available imaging to ensure evaluation of the lesion will not be obscured by normal hepatobiliary excretion of 18F-FFNP
Patients with a lesion < 2 mm
Patient has at least 1 focal lesion in liver
New or increased enhancing brain lesion(s) OR nonenhancing brain lesion(s) if receiving anti-angiogenic therapy, which is considered indeterminate for tumor progression versus (vs) radiation injury by the neuroradiologist or clinician

Subject has oral lesion

Patients with a solid lung lesion 1.5-5cm identified on chest computed tomography (CT) (obtained within previous 3 months) with the intention to undergo bronchoscopic evaluation; if the lesion is partially solid (i.e. there is a ground glass component) then the solid portion must make up > 75% of the lesion and measure at 1.5-5cm; the decision to pursue biopsy will be made by the treating physician and agreed upon by the patient; this will include patients determined to have an intermediate risk of malignancy (5-65%) and those non-surgical candidate with higher risk lesions in need of diagnosis for alternative treatment; OR
Patients with a solid lung lesion 1.5-5cm identified on chest CT (obtained within previous 3 months) that are surgical candidates with a high probability of cancer (> 65%) will be referred for surgical evaluation; if the lesion is partially solid (i.e. there is a ground glass component) then the solid portion must make up > 75% of the lesion and measure at 1.5-5cm; if the patient refuses surgery or if the surgeon requests a definitive diagnosis prior to surgery the patient will have the option to be included in this study; all sites will use the same online calculator to document probability of malignancy
