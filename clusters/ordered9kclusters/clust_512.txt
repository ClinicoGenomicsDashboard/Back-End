Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is required for all patients, unless contraindicated; this may be acquired prior to study entry or after enrollment prior to SBRT planning
Metastatic disease beyond the neck or supraclavicular area as demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or biopsy

Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease by positron emission tomography (PET).
Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) avid disease on baseline scan For enrollment in part 2, patients must meet all of the following:
Patients must have pathologic diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), by either histologic biopsy, or cytologic evidence; highly suspicious cytology (i.e. abnormal cells suspicious for malignancy) is acceptable, in the setting of a strongly positive computed tomography (CT)/positron emission tomography (PET) (standardized uptake value [SUV] > 5.0)
Systemic staging including computed tomography (CT) that covers the chest, liver and adrenal glands or a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is required and must be negative for metastatic spread; if a patient is unable to tolerate MRI or has a contraindication to MRI, a head CT scan with and without contrast is acceptable
There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy to start of device treatment; when the interval is less than 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy, the histological confirmation of progression must be unequivocal per Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria; the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scan, perfusion imaging, and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy to differentiate between true early progression and pseudoprogression prior to biopsy or resection of probable recurrent tumor is per standard of care
No evidence of metastatic disease on imaging by whole body bone scan (technetium-99 or sodium fluoride [Na-F] positron emission tomography [PET] bone scan) and cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen/pelvis (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) within 6 weeks of day 1 of protocol therapy
N2-3 lymph node involvement based on positron emission tomography (PET)/endobronchial ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EBUS-FNA)/mediastinoscopy (any N2 disease that is more than just minimal single station involvement is excluded)
Measurable, 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG)-avid (Deauville score ? 3) systemic disease (using Lugano Classification response criteria) by positron emission tomography (PET)-diagnostic computed tomography (CT). Baseline scans must be of acceptable quality to the central radiology laboratory prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.
Patients must have failed prior external beam radiation therapy; a positron emission tomography (PET) or thallium single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), MR spectroscopy and MR perfusion, or surgical documentation may be done at the discretion of the treating physician if there is a question of radiation changes/necrosis versus progressive disease
Have no evidence of distant metastases (as determined by endoscopic ultrasound [EUS], PET-computed tomography [CT] or staging laparoscopy)
Positron emission tomography (PET) avid disease with standard uptake value (SUV) > 5
Centers that standardly use positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to determine a diagnosis of radionecrosis are permitted to use these modalities to assist in their patient selection; however the criteria described for conventional MR and/or DSC should also be met for study eligibility; both PET and MRS are not mandatory for study eligibility
Patients must have no evidence of metastasis on positron emission tomography (PET) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis and chest imaging
Patients with any radiographic evidence of metastases, including plain x-ray, bone scan, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or positron emission tomography (PET) scan

Fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) avid tumors

Subjects must have had a baseline scan (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or positron emission tomography-computer tomography [PET/CT]) of the chest to assess disease burden before starting on first line chemotherapy for NSCLC and those images must have been reviewed by the investigator prior to randomization. If the scan was performed more than 28 days prior to randomization, an additional scan must be performed and reviewed by the investigator to confirm that the patient has not progressed before randomization.
No evidence of relapsed or residual malignancy within 30 days of trial entry; all patients must undergo appropriate staging for their malignancy (i.e. bone marrow aspiration for the leukemias and positron emission tomography [PET]-computed tomography [CT] scanning for the lymphomas); evidence of a persistent cytogenetic abnormality will constitute evidence of residual or relapsed disease in the leukemias, where present; individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are eligible if there is no more than 20% residual leukemia in the bone marrow at the time of study entry
NHL\r\n* No clinical evidence of disease or disease-related symptoms\r\n* Typically fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymphomas: a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is positron emission tomography (PET) negative\r\n* Variably FDG-avid lymphoma/FDG avidity unknown: all lymph nodes normal size by computed tomography (CT)\r\n* Spleen and liver non-palpable and without nodules\r\n* If pretreatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, repeat bone marrow biopsy must be negative; if morphologically indeterminate, immunohistochemistry should be negative
Evidence of progressive disease by imaging modalities or biopsy - persistent positron emission tomography (PET) activity, though possibly related to lymphoma, is not an exclusion criterion in the absence of computed tomography (CT) changes indicating progression
