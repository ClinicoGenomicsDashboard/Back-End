Subjectâ€™s biopsy specimen reveals neuroendocrine or small cell features
High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (HGNEC), any organ of origin, including a pathology of neuroendocrine features, in patients previously been treated with chemotherapy Although neuroendocrine tumors may be classified differently based on organ of origin, in the context of this protocol they are defined as high grade on the basis of either
Histologic features: (a) Neuroendocrine tumors of lung origin are considered high grade if in any part of the tumors, there are >10 mitoses/2mm2 or 10 high power field (HPF). Large zones of necrosis are usually present. This includes small cell lung carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma. [SCLC will not enroll in the HGNEC cohort.] (b)Neuroendocrine tumors of gastroenteropancreatic origin are considered high grade if in any part of the tumors there are either >20 mitoses/2mm2 or 10 high power field (HPF) OR Ki67.
