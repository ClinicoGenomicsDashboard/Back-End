Childbearing potential and agrees to use method(s) of contraception. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in consultation with the investigator. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.
Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year.

Therefore, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 7 months (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.
