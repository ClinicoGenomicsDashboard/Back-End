Previous diagnosis of multiple myeloma based on standard criteria; tests need not be performed within 30 days of registration
Multiple myeloma diagnosed according to standard criteria either currently or at the time of initial diagnosis
Adult male or female participants 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) according to standard criteria.
Meeting the criteria for symptomatic multiple myeloma (hypercalcemia renal [kidney] impairment, anemia, bone lesions \[CRAB]” criteria) before the initiation of systemic chemotherapy
Symptomatic multiple myeloma of any subtype in any disease stage, providing the patient does not have smoldering myeloma, and otherwise met standard criteria (hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia and/or bone lesions – CRAB criteria) for induction therapy
Participants must have documented symptomatic myeloma, with organ damage related to myeloma as defined above with laboratory assessments
Symptomatic multiple myeloma or any evidence of CRAB criteria including the new criteria for overt myeloma; any prior therapy for active myeloma should also be excluded; prior therapy for smoldering myeloma is not an exclusion criterion; bisphosphonates are not excluded
Adult male or female participants 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma according to standard criteria.
Patients must have a diagnosis of myeloma (see Appendix A for diagnostic criteria).
Male or female patients 18 years or older diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma according to standard criteria who have not received prior treatment
Multiple myeloma diagnosed according to standard criteria either currently or at the time of initial diagnosis. NOTE: The initial diagnosis must have been symptomatic multiple myeloma, although the relapsed disease did not need to be symptomatic.
Having symptomatic multiple myeloma, defined by any of the following (if due to myeloma): lytic bone lesions, severe osteopenia (low bone density), pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), kidney insufficiency; symptomatic hyperviscosity of the blood, or recurrent serious bacterial infections such as pneumonia
Patients meeting the criteria for symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM):\r\n* Lytic lesions on skeletal survey or\r\n* Plasmacytoma\r\nPatients meeting International Myeloma Working Group definition of symptomatic myeloma with symptoms only related to associated amyloidosis who would otherwise only meet the criteria for smoldering MM are potentially eligible
Meets diagnostic criteria for symptomatic multiple myeloma
Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to standard criteria or patients with a diagnosis of an advanced malignant solid tumor for which standard, curative, or life prolonging treatment does not exist or is no longer effective. Patients with multiple myeloma must have had at least 1 prior therapy
Symptomatic multiple myeloma or asymptomatic myeloma with myeloma-related organ damage diagnosed according to standard criteria
Is diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma or asymptomatic myeloma with myeloma-related organ damage according to standard criteria
Previously untreated, symptomatic multiple myeloma as defined by the 3 criteria below:
Clinically overt multiple myeloma (i.e. original hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, bone lesions [CRAB] criteria); Note: extent of marrow plasmacytosis is not prohibitive
