Marginal zone lymphoma (extranodal, nodal or splenic). Subjects with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue must have progressed after Helicobacter pylori therapy and radiation. Subjects with splenic marginal zone lymphoma must have prior splenectomy.
Subjects must have histologically determined B cell NHL that is relapsed or primary refractory after initial therapy\r\n* Follicular lymphoma of any grade\r\n* Marginal zone lymphoma (extranodal, nodal, or splenic); patients with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) must have progressed after Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) therapy and radiation; patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) must have prior splenectomy
Marginal zone lymphoma (splenic, nodal, or extranodal)
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (splenic, nodal, or extra-nodal)
Non-WM must have at least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (which has not been previously irradiated) according to the Lugano Classification. For patients with splenic MZL (Marginal-zone lymphoma) this requirement may be restricted to splenomegaly alone since that is usually the only manifestation of measurable disease.
Follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphomas (splenic, nodal, or extranodal/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] type)\r\n* Primary refractory disease\r\n* Relapse after >= 2 prior regimens\r\n* Relapse/progression after autologous HSCT
Indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which may include the following:\r\n* Nodal marginal zone lymphoma\r\n* Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)\r\n* Splenic marginal zone lymphoma\r\n* Follicular lymphoma grade 1-3a with low tumor burden, Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) 2 risk category of either low (i.e. no risk factors) or intermediate (1-2 risk factors), and with no B symptoms. B symptoms are defined as:\r\n** Fever (i.e., temperature > 38 degree Celsius (C) [> 100.4 degree Fahrenheit (F)]) for 3 consecutive days\r\n** Weight loss exceeding 10% of body weight in 6 months\r\n** Drenching night sweats\r\n* Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\r\n*** Low tumor burden is defined as normal lactate dehydrogenase, largest nodal or extranodal mass less than 7 cm, up to three nodal sites containing nodes with a diameter greater than 3 cm, no clinically significant serous effusions detectable by physical examination or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan, and spleen enlargement up to 16 cm by CT without any evidence of portal hypertension
