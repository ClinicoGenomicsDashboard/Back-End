Hearing loss that would preclude participating in telephone sessions (determined by brief hearing assessment administered by research staff at each National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program [NCORP] component); individuals who can compensate for hearing loss through the use of a hearing device or telecommunication device for the deaf (TDD) phone, and through the use of such devices are able to communicate with the study therapist by telephone, will be included; if the therapist cannot communicate with the participant by telephone, the participant will be excluded
Neither has a significant hearing impairment precluding intervention session participation
Hearing loss that would preclude participating in interventions; adequate hearing to participate will be determined via: (1) response of “no” to the question [“Do you have a hearing problem now?”]; participants with hearing aids will be allowed to enroll as long as their hearing is adequate to hear the sounds on the study devices; if necessary, potential study participants will receive a brief test trial with the RESPeRATE device; if they indicate inability to hear the guiding tones, they will not be enrolled in the study
