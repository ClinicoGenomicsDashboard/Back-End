If there is a known mutation in a hereditary breast cancer susceptibility gene in a participant's family member, the participant herself must have undergone genetic testing as per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines to be eligible per this criterion.)
Modified Gail/CARE model risk at 5 years ? 1.67%. (Note: Risk models are to be used only if there is no known previous diagnosis of resected ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or LCIS and there is no known deleterious mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, or TP53)
10% or more probability of BRCA mutation by BRCAPRO or similar model
Documented germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes
Known carrier of a BRCA1 or 2 mutation
Women seeking an RRSO or RRS at MSK, including breast cancer 1 (BRCA 1)/breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) mutation carriers and women with a strong family history of breast and or/ovarian cancer
Subject has BRCA 1 or 2 mutations. Note: Testing will only be required for Subjects presenting with bilateral breast cancer; testing is not required for unilateral cancers
Patients with known breast cancer (BRCA) mutations; patients who are not tested or whose testing result is not returned at the time of registration are not excluded from registering to this study
Patients enrolling in the BRCA-deficient cohorts must have a documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation; alternatively, patients with tumors harboring somatic BRCA mutations may also enroll after discussion with the principal investigator
Premenopausal women with a documented BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation; menopause is defined as >= 12 months of amenorrhea
Women without a documented BRCA mutation
No patients with known deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA) genes
Participants with a known BRCA 1 or 2 mutation
Participants with a known breast cancer (BRCA) 1 or 2 mutation
Negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
Patients must not have known deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA) genes

Documented BRCA mutation, with the following exceptions: a) Patient is intended to be\n             enrolled in a Single-patient Cohort; b) Patient has an advanced DNA repair\n             mutation-positive solid tumor and is intended to be enrolled in Expansion Cohort 5.\n\n             Patients in the Dose-escalation Phase:\n\n          7. Locally advanced solid tumor other than a primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor\n             for which the patient has received ?3 prior lines\n\n          8. Confirmed solid tumor in one of the following categories:\n\n               -  BRCA mutation-positive pancreatic cancer for which the patient received up to 1\n                  prior line of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the advanced disease setting.\n\n               -  Advanced BRCA mutation-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) for\n                  which the patient received up to 2 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the\n                  advanced disease setting.\n\n               -  Advanced BRCA mutation-positive ovarian cancer for which the patient received up\n                  to 3 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the advanced disease setting.\n\n               -  Advanced BRCA mutation-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) for which\n                  the patient received up to 3 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the\n                  advanced disease setting.\n\n               -  Advanced DNA repair mutation-positive solid tumors, including, but not limited to\n                  BRCA and non-BRCA DNA mutations, who have received up to 3 prior lines of\n                  cytotoxic chemotherapy in the advanced disease setting. DNA-repair mutations may\n                  include, but are not limited to ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, and RAD51D.
