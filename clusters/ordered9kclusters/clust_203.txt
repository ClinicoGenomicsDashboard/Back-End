Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy that have not resolved to CTCAE, version 4.0, grade =< 1 or baseline, with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values listed
Subject has toxicity from previous anticancer therapy that has not recovered to ? Grade 1 or to their baseline level of organ function prior to enrollment (except for non-clinically significant toxicities, e.g., alopecia, vitiligo).
Persistent toxicities (>= CTCAE grade 2) with the exception of alopecia, caused by previous cancer therapy
Has unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to NCI-CTCAE v4, grade =< 1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per the discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor (eg, grade 2 chemotherapy-induced neuropathy).

Has unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to NCI-CTCAE v4, Grade =<1 or baseline. Subjects with chronic Grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor (eg, Grade 2 chemotherapy-induced neuropathy).
