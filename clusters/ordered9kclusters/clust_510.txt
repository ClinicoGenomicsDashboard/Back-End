Patients must not have any evidence of residual or metastatic renal cell cancer on computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, all with oral and intravenous (IV) contrast after nephrectomy and within a maximum of 28 days prior to registration; a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the abdomen/pelvis with gadolinium and a non-contrast CT of the chest is an acceptable imaging alternative; non-contrast CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis should only be performed if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is in the best medical interest of the patient to not receive IV contrast of any form; NOTE: positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is not an acceptable imaging alternative; patients who display subcentimeter pulmonary nodules (by CT scan) that are non-specific and considered unlikely to represent metastatic disease by the treating investigator will be considered eligible
