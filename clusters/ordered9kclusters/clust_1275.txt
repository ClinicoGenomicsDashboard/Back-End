Patients must have a serum triglyceride level =< 300 mg/dL and serum cholesterol level =< 300 mg/dL; if an initial random draw (i.e. non-fasting) is out of range, it is acceptable to repeat this test as a fasting draw
Serum triglyceride level =< 300 mg/dL and serum cholesterol =< 300 mg/dL; if these labs were drawn non-fasting and do not meet the eligibility criteria then it is suggested that they are repeated fasting, i.e. no food or drink other than water for 8 hours; the use of medication to achieve these parameters is not allowed
Total cholesterol < 300 mg/dL
Patients must have a fasting LDL cholesterol within the normal range per institutional guidelines
Fasting serum cholesterol =< 300 mg/dL
Fasting triglyceride =< 2.5 x ULN
Fasting cholesterol =< 1.5 x ULN
Fasting serum triglyceride level =< 500 mg/dL
Serum cholesterol levels must be less than grade 2 (< 300 mg/dL), and serum triglyceride levels must be less than grade 2 (< 2.5 x ULN)
Fasting or non-fasting serum triglyceride level =< 300 mg/dL and serum cholesterol level =< 300 mg/dL
Cholesterol =< 300 mg/dL

Fasting cholesterol =< 240 mg/dL; ONLY APPLICABLE for patients with NF2 mutation (GSK2256098)
Serum triglyceride =< 300 mg/dL (applicable only for dose levels that include isotretinoin) (note that a non-fasting triglyceride value could be obtained, if this is > 300 mg/dL then a fasting triglyceride should be obtained and patient will be eligible if the fasting level is =< 300 mg/dL)
Fasting serum cholesterol =< 300 mg/dL OR =< 7.75 mmol/L
History of hypertriglyceridemia with triglyceride levels > 200 mg/dl; patients with triglyceride levels < 200 receiving treatment for hypertriglyceridemia or hyperlipidemia are considered eligible
Fasting serum triglyceride level =< 500 mg/dL
Fasting serum cholesterol less than or equal to 300 mg/dL
Have plasma total cholesterol < 300 mg/dL
Have plasma total cholesterol > 300 mg/dL
Serum triglyceride level =< 300 mg/dL (=< 3.42 mmol/L)
Serum cholesterol level =< 300 mg/dL (7.75 mmol/L)
Subject has cholesterol panel and triglyceride done before first treatment
Cholesterol level =< 350 mg/dl; fasting is not required before testing, but if elevated without fasting, repetition with fasting can be performed to determine eligibility
May be on cholesterol medications
