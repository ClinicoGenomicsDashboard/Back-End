Pregnant or breast-feeding women; women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must undergo a negative pregnancy test (either serum or urine) prior to study entry; male and female patients of reproductive potential need to employ two highly effective and acceptable forms of contraception throughout their participation in the study and for 90 days after last dose of study drug; WOCBP include:\r\n* Any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or oophorectomy) or who is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrheic >= 12 consecutive months)\r\n* Women on hormone replacement therapy with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone level > 35 mIU/ml\r\n* Women who are using oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as intrauterine device or barrier methods to prevent pregnancy or are practicing abstinence of where the partner is sterile
Pregnant women are excluded from this study; women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of treatment, and for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately; prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy; in addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential; all WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of the investigational agent(s); registration may occur prior to this pregnancy test; if the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive protocol treatment and must not be enrolled in the study; WOCBP is defined as follows: any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or a bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea >= 12 consecutive months, or women on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] with documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level > 35 mIU/ml); even women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy), should be considered to be a WOCBP
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized
