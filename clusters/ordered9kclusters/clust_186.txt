Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances:\r\n* Synchronous or metachronous primary non-small cell lung cancers, of lower stage than the cancer for which adjuvant treatment is currently being prescribed\r\n* Disease-free for at least 3 years, and deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy\r\n* Cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\r\n* Other low grade and good-prognosis cancers such as, but not limited to, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), prostate cancer, carcinoid cancer etc.
Participants with another invasive malignancy in the last 2 years (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma and tumors deemed by the investigator to be of low likelihood for recurrence)
Individuals with a history of a different malignancy, other than cervical cancer in situ, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, are ineligible, except if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years, and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy OR other primary malignancy is neither currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention
Other malignancy within five years, unless the probability of recurrence of the prior malignancy is <5% as determined by the Principal Investigator based on available information. Patient's curatively treated for squamous and basal cell carcinoma of the skin or patients with a history of malignant tumor in the past that have been disease free for at least five years are also eligible for this study.
Patients with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances: if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; patients with treated cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; patients will not be eligible if they have evidence of other malignancy requiring therapy other than surgery within the last 3 years
Other malignancy within five years, unless the probability of recurrence of the prior malignancy is <5% as determined by the Principal Investigator based on available information. Patient's curatively treated for squamous and basal cell carcinoma of the skin or patients with a history of malignant tumor in the past that have been disease free for at least five years are also eligible for this study.
Individuals with a history of other malignancies are ineligible unless they:\r\n* Have been disease-free for at least 5 years or are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence or progression of that malignancy\r\n* Have the following cancers if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
Patient has a history of invasive malignancy other than Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). Patients are eligible, if they are disease-free for at least 3 years and deemed to be at low risk for recurrence by the investigator.
