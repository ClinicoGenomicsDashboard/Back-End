Patients with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, or ketoacidosis; Note: during the study, metformin must be discontinued for 24 hours before and 48 hours after imaging involving intravenous (IV) contrast to minimize risk of lactic acidosis
Patient has any condition associated with increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (e.g. congestive heart failure defined as New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV functional status, history of acidosis of any type; habitual intake of 3 or more alcoholic beverages per day)
Patients with plasma bicarbonate less than 22 mEq/L or history of lactic or any other metabolic acidosis
Subject currently being treated with biguanides or other agents known to increase risk of lactic acidosis.
Condition associated with increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis:\r\n* New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure\r\n* Intake of 3 or more alcoholic beverages per day\r\n* Known history of lactic acidosis
Patients with history or evidence of lactic acidosis or metabolic acidosis will be excluded
A history of metabolic acidosis, including ketoacidosis or increased risk of lactic acidosis

History of lactic acidosis
Have a history of lactic acidosis or risk factors for lactic acidosis

Active or history of lactic acidosis, metabolic acidosis, or diabetic ketoacidosis
History of lactic acidosis as per prior medical records or provided by the patient
Metabolic acidosis, acute or chronic; acidosis will be defined a blood pH < 7.35; acidosis will be suspected if serum bicarbonate is < 22 mEq/L; in such cases, venous blood pH would be checked to confirm or exclude acidosis
