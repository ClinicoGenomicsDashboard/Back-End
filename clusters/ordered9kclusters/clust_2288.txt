Bilateral DCIS: bilateral breast imaging ? 90 days of registration (must include bilateral mammogram; can also include ultrasound or breast MRI)
Patients must have had a bilateral mammogram within 12 months prior to registration, unless the initial surgery was a total mastectomy, in which case only a mammogram of the remaining breast is required; (subjects with bilateral total mastectomies do not require imaging)
Patients with synchronous bilateral invasive disease are eligible as long as all the lesions assessed for HER2 on both sides are negative
Patients with current and symptomatic pneumonitis, or extensive bilateral lung disease on high resolution CT scan
Participants with bilateral diffuse lymphangitic carcinomatosis

Bilateral breast cancer
Bilateral breast cancer is permitted; patients with bilateral breast cancer will be stratified as left-sided
Prior bilateral orchiectomy
Male is sterile due to a bilateral orchiectomy
Multifocal gliomas that are bilateral; patients with unilateral multifocal gliomas may be eligible if their multifocal disease can be treated effectively and safely in a single MLA procedure; also note that corpus callosal tumors are eligible even if they are bilateral as long as they satisfy the size and shape limits of MLA as determined by the performing neurosurgeon
Patients with simultaneous primaries or bilateral tumors are excluded, with the exception of patients with bilateral tonsil cancers or patients with T1-2, N0, M0 resected differentiated thyroid carcinoma, who are eligible
Synchronous bilateral breast cancer at the time of diagnosis
Extensive bilateral lung disease on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan
Bilateral breast cancers are allowed if the treating clinician has determined the patient should be treated as ER+ and HER2- negative
Bilateral invasive BC.
Bilateral breast cancer
Patients with simultaneous primaries or bilateral tumors are excluded, with the exception of patients with bilateral tonsil cancers or patients with T1-2, N0, M0 differentiated thyroid carcinoma (resected or management deferred), who are eligible
Bilateral synchronous breast cancer
Bilateral ocular adnexal involvement is permitted, if biopsy confirms unilateral disease and there is high clinical suspicion for bilateral disease, biopsy of the contralateral ocular adnexa can be waived
Histologically proven unilateral or bilateral primary breast carcinoma; (in case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint)
Multiple or bilateral renal masses
Choose bilateral mastectomy followed by bilateral immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction
Multicentric or bilateral disease unless biopsy of the clinical abnormalities are performed and result is negative.
Patients with bilateral synchronous renal masses
Patient must have had a bilateral mammogram prior to NAC unless there is only one breast
Ongoing therapy with LHRH analog or bilateral orchiectomy.
Cases involving a bilateral operation
Bilateral breast malignancy
Patients with simultaneous primaries or bilateral tumors are excluded, with the exception of patients with bilateral tonsil cancers or patients with T1-2, N0, M0 differentiated thyroid carcinoma, who are eligible
Patients with simultaneous primaries or bilateral tumors are excluded, with the exception of patients with bilateral tonsil cancers or patients with T1-2, N0, M0 resected differentiated thyroid carcinoma, who are eligible
Peripheral bilateral edema requiring active medical management
Patients with simultaneous primaries or bilateral tumors are excluded, with the exception of patients with bilateral tonsil cancers or patients with T1-2, N0, M0 resected differentiated thyroid carcinoma, who are eligible
Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy
Current unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis
Completely resected unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast
Patients with simultaneous primaries or bilateral tumors.
Participants with multicentric (multiple tumors involving more than 1 quadrant) or bilateral breast cancer
Physician recommendation of bilateral neck radiation
History of or plans for bilateral mastectomies within the next 12 months
Unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma (RB) patients are eligible
Participants with synchronous bilateral invasive disease are eligible only if both lesions are HER2-positive
For subjects with two breasts, they must have had a bilateral mammogram prior to surgery
Patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancers are eligible if at least one of the tumors is HER2-positive
Bilateral breast cancers that individually meet eligibility criteria are allowed
Prior bilateral orchiectomy
Unifocal breast cancer (no evidence of gross multifocal disease, multicentric, or bilateral disease)
Bilateral pulmonary metastasis
Male subject is sterile due to a bilateral orchiectomy.
Patients who have not had a bilateral orchiectomy must have a plan to maintain effective GnRG-analogue therapy for the duration of the trial
Vasectomy or other procedure resulting in infertility (eg, bilateral orchiectomy) for >6 months
Vasectomy or other procedure resulting in infertility (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy), performed at least 6 months before screening
Patients with bilateral disease
Prior bilateral orchiectomy
Patients are having bilateral mastectomy
Participants with bilateral synchronous or metachronous disease (DCIS, LCIS, ADH, ALH) are eligible
Bilateral disease (diagnosed cancer in both breasts)

Multiple or bilateral renal masses when more than one mass is operated on at the same time or within 4-months of each other
Bilateral breast cancer
Have any blood relatives diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer
Bilateral tibial dysplasia
Patients with bilateral upper extremity edema
Patient with bilateral manipulation of axilla within the last 24 months
Subjects with bilateral breast cancer are not eligible
Bilateral breast cancer or planned bilateral mastectomy
