Symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement in the lungs resulting in dyspnea at rest
At least moderate dyspnea defined by a BDI score of 6 or less in the self-administered computerized versions of the baseline and transition dyspnea indexes (SAC-BDI/TDI); (this cutoff score is close to the score of 5.7 used to define \moderate dyspnea\ in the publication that validated the instrument and is selected by attending physicians in the pulmonary service as a good indication of \ moderate dyspnea\ in clinical practice; a typical person with BDI of 6, for example, would be a 52 year old woman who has to pause when walking because of dyspnea and/or has eliminated doing an activity because of dyspnea)
Symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest
Dyspnea with an average intensity >= 4 on the dyspnea NRS (range 0-10) over the past week.
Dyspnea numeric rating scale at rest >= 3 of 10 (average over last 24 hour)
Breakthrough dyspnea, defined as dyspnea with an average intensity level over the past 7 days of at least 3/10 on a numeric rating scale upon significant exertion or continuous dyspnea =< 7/10 with worsening upon significant exertion
Dyspnea at rest >= 7/10 at the time of enrollment
Patients with ESAS > 4/10 on dyspnea
Subject has a history of at least 1 ipsilateral pleural effusion causing dyspnea that responded to thoracentesis where the lung expanded and the dyspnea was improved.
