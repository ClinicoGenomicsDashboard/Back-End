Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except in patients with Gilbert’s disease
Total bilirubin =< 2 times upper limit of normal (x ULN) (=< 3 x ULN if considered to be due to leukemic involvement or Gilbert’s syndrome)
Total bilirubin < 1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN) except Gilbert’s syndrome where < 3 x ULN is allowed
Total serum bilirubin < 2 x upper limit of normal (unless due to hemolysis or Gilbert’s syndrome, then no upper limit)
Total bilirubin: within normal institutional limits; if, however, the participant has Gilbert’s disease or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia which is felt to be secondary to with atazanavir or indinavir therapy, then the total bilirubin must be =< 3 x upper limit of normal [ULN])
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless Gilbert’s syndrome or disease infiltration of the liver is present)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper normal limit, or =< 5 x upper normal limit if documented hepatic involvement with lymphoma or history of Gilbert’s syndrome
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\r\n* Patients with Gilbert’s disease: =< 3 x ULN
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); for subjects with known Gilbert’s disease or similar syndrome with slow conjugation of bilirubin, total bilirubin =< 3.0 mg/dL
Total bilirubin must be =< the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (> ULN to 1.5 x ULN) resulting from Gilbert’s disease or similar syndrome due to slow conjugation of bilirubin; and
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless due to Gilbert’s disease; if total bilirubin is > 1.5 x ULN, a direct bilirubin should be performed and must be < 1.5 mg/dL for Gilbert’s to be diagnosed
Serum total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients with documented Gilbert’s syndrome)
Serum bilirubin =< upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for subjects with Gilbert’s disease who are eligible despite elevated serum bilirubin level)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR in patients with Gilbert’s syndrome, a total bilirubin =< 3.0
Serum bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or =< 3 x ULN for patients with Gilbert’s disease
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), unless presence of Gilbert’s syndrome
Total bilirubin > institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless due to hemolysis or Gilbert’s disease
Total bilirubin > 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless documented Gilbert’s syndrome)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (unless associated with Gilbert’s syndrome)
Total/direct bilirubin < 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal; patients with elevation of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin alone, as in Gilbert’s syndrome, are eligible
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert’s syndrome
Serum total bilirubin < 2.0 x upper limit normal (ULN) (or < 3.0 x ULN if deemed to be elevated due to leukemia or Gilbert’s syndrome)
Total bilirubin =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except if the elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome (allowable at =< 5 x ULN) or myelofibrosis (per principle investigator [PI] discretion)
Total bilirubin < 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (unless associated with Gilbert’s syndrome)
Total bilirubin =< 1.2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless due to Gilbert’s disease
Total bilirubin >= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless documented Gilbert’s)
Unless felt due to underlying disease and approved by the overall PI: Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); patients with Gilbert’s disease may have total bilirubin up to =< 3 x institutional ULN
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, unless there is a known history of Gilbert’s disease
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); an exception to this may be allowed for participants with Gilbert’s syndrome with documented approval by the protocol chair
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Note: Higher total bilirubin levels (=< 3 mg/dL) can be allowed if due to known benign liver condition, i.e. Gilbert’s
Within 28 days prior to signing consent: Total bilirubin > upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless the patient has documented Gilbert’s syndrome)
Total bilirubin =< 2 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or history of Gilbert’s syndrome
Obtained within 28 days prior to registration: Bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (subjects with known Gilbert’s disease should have a serum bilirubin =< 3 x ULN)
Bilirubin > 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless with Gilberts syndrome or
Bilirubin = < 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) except for patients (pts) with (w/) documented history of Gilbert’s disease, obtained within 14 days prior to PET scan
Bilirubin < 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless Gilbert’s is suspected)
Bilirubin > 2 x institutional upper limits of normal (ULN), with exception of patients with Gilberts disease
Bilirubin (total) =< 1.5 times upper limit normal (with exception of Gilberts syndrome)
Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); patients with Gilbert’s syndrome are excluded from this requirement
