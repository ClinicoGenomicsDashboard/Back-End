Patient and urologist must agree that patient is suitable for prostatectomy
Indications for post-prostatectomy radiation exist:\r\n* Disease progression (detectable PSA on two measurements obtained at least one month apart) or\r\n* Indications for adjuvant radiation exist (if undetectable PSA): pathologic T3, T4, N+ disease or positive margins (within 1 year of prostatectomy)
If have untreated primary prostate cancer: must undergo debulking prostatectomy
Patient is suitable for prostatectomy.
Prior prostatectomy
Diagnosis of prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy
Willing to use appropriate contraception from time of NanoPac® injection until prostatectomy
Prior prostatectomy
Prior local therapy with prostatectomy required, with available tissue from prostatectomy specimen to send for genomic and transcriptomic testing; specifically, either formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks or 35-40 unstained slides from the primary prostatectomy specimen will need to be available for central pathologic review and processing
No prior prostatectomy or prostatic radiation
Prior prostatectomy
Willingness to use barrier contraception from the time of first dose of MGA271 until the time of prostatectomy
Willing to undergo prostatectomy as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer
Prior total prostatectomy or cryotherapy of the prostate
Patients who received hormone therapy before prostatectomy
Previous prostatectomy, cryosurgery, or high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for prostate cancer
Previous prostate cancer surgery to include: prostatectomy, hyperthermia and cryosurgery
No prior prostatectomy or cryotherapy of the prostate
Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to radical prostatectomy is allowed, and post-prostatectomy hormonal therapy is allowed only if the onset of androgen ablation is =< 90 days prior to the date of registration
Presence of multiple small bowel loops trapped within the immediate tumor bed (post hysterectomy or prostatectomy)
A post-radical prostatectomy study entry PSA >= 45 days after prostatectomy and within 30 days prior to step 1, < 2.0 ng/mL
Androgen deprivation therapy started prior to prostatectomy for > 6 months (180 days) duration; \r\n* Note: The use of finasteride or dutasteride (± tamsulosin) for longer periods prior to prostatectomy is acceptable

Patients will have been originally diagnosed with prostate carcinoma and have undergone what was considered definitive non-prostatectomy therapy for localized disease
Patients with a malignancy within the past 3 years for which study drugs or a prostatectomy is a contraindication
No prior local therapy (prostatectomy, radiation, cryotherapy) or hormonal therapy for prostate cancer
Prostatectomy at M. D. Anderson within 3 months from the time of MRSI
Patients will have been originally diagnosed with localized (stage T1c, T2, or T3) prostate carcinoma and have undergone what was considered definitive non-prostatectomy therapy for localized disease
Greater than T3 disease in past and/or treated with prostatectomy
All men undergoing robotic prostatectomy or cystoprostatectomy at City of Hope will be eligible for the study
