Breast imaging should include imaging of the ipsilateral axilla; for subjects with a clinically negative axilla, a sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed either up front or after preoperative therapy at the discretion of the subjectâ€™s physicians; for subjects with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration, core biopsy or sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure will be performed prior to registration to confirm the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes; while not mandated by the protocol, it is strongly recommended that participants with positive lymph nodes undergo a level I and II lymph node dissection at the time of definitive surgery; participants with axillary adenopathy only are not eligible for this study
All subjects (both adjuvant and neoadjuvant) must have sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection, as per pre-specified institutional guidelines
Patients must have undergone axillary staging by sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)\r\n* For patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes, sentinel node biopsy alone is allowed provided that the patient completed either whole breast or chest wall radiation and the primary tumor is < 5 cm\r\n* All patients with >= 4 positive lymph nodes must have completed ALND (with or without prior sentinel node biopsy)
The patient must have completed one of the procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status listed below.\r\n* Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone:\r\n** If pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN0 or pN1b;\r\n** If pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN1mi or pN1a and the patient has undergone breast conserving surgery (with planned breast radiotherapy), the primary tumor must be T1 or T2 by pathologic evaluation and the nodal involvement must be limited to 1 or 2 positive nodes\r\n* Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes if the sentinel node (SN) is positive; or\r\n* Axillary lymphadenectomy with or without SN isolation procedure
No prior ipsilateral axillary surgery, such as excisional biopsy of lymph node(s) or treatment of hidradenitis
Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and sentinel lymph node surgery must be completed within 56 days of the completion of the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
A minimum of 1 sentinel node and a maximum of 6 total nodes (sentinel + non-sentinel) are identified and excised by the surgeon; patients who do not have an identifiable sentinel lymph node will not proceed to registration/randomization
At least one lymph node (sentinel or non-sentinel) with a metastasis greater than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension identified on intra-operative pathologic assessment\r\n* Note: Isolated tumor cells (metastases less than or equal to 0.2 mm) will be treated as node negative disease (N0i+)\r\n* Note: If on final pathology, more than 8 lymph nodes are seen pathologically, then the patient should discontinue study\r\n* Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is not to be performed prior to registration/randomization
For cases where ALND has not been performed and one of the following is true: 1) intra-operative evaluation of sentinel lymph node could not be/was not performed and final pathology identified a positive lymph node (sentinel or non-sentinel) with metastasis greater than 0.2 mm OR 2) lymph node (sentinel or non-sentinel) considered negative on intra-operative evaluation was found to be positive on final pathology (with metastasis greater than 0.2 mm)
Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and sentinel lymph node surgery must be completed within 56 days of the completion of the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy; negative margin (by either breast conservation or mastectomy) on final pathology where negative margin is defined as no tumor on ink
At least one lymph node (sentinel or non-sentinel) with a metastasis greater than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension identified on final pathology (for cases where intra-operative evaluation was not performed, or was negative and completion dissection was not performed)
Among the minimum of 1 and the maximum of 6 lymph nodes (sentinel + non-sentinel) identified and excised by the surgeon, no more than 8 lymph nodes (sentinel and non-sentinel) were found by the pathologists to have been actually excised; \r\n* Note: Isolated tumor cells (metastases less than or equal to 0.2 mm) will be treated as node negative disease (N0i+)
At the time of definitive surgery, all removed axillary nodes must be histologically free from cancer; acceptable procedures for assessment of axillary nodal status at the time of surgery include:\r\n* Axillary node dissection\r\n* Sentinel node biopsy alone provided that at least 2 sentinel lymph nodes are removed; removal of at least 3 sentinel lymph nodes and use of dual tracer for lymphatic mapping are strongly recommended or\r\n* Sentinel node biopsy followed by axillary node dissection\r\nNote: patients are eligible whether there is residual invasive carcinoma in the surgical breast specimen or whether there is evidence of pathologic complete response; patients who are found to be pathologically node-positive at the time of surgery, based on sentinel node biopsy alone, are candidates for A011202, a study developed by the Alliance in Oncology, an National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cooperative Group; if A011202 is open at the investigator's institution, patients should be approached about participating in the A011202 study

It is preferred that axillary lymph node sampling is performed after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to allow more accurate assessment of pathologic response; patients must have a complete axillary lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the following situations (exceptions will be granted for patients participating in the Alliance A11202 trial):\r\n* Patients had documented pathologic involvement of the axillary nodes (fine needle aspiration [FNA] or core biopsy) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with positive sentinel node(s)\r\n* Patient had documented pathologic involvement of the axillary nodes (FNA or core biopsy) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had only 1 sentinel lymph node removed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy\r\n** NOTE: Patients who undergo sentinel node biopsy before starting neoadjuvant treatment and do not undergo post neoadjuvant assessment of the axillary nodes or who have negative axillary nodes on post neoadjuvant assessment must have >= 1 cm residual invasive cancer in the breast after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
