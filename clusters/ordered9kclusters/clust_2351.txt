Prior therapy\r\n* Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy, high-dose therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment\r\n* Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens (a total of 3 cytotoxic regimens) for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the following definition:\r\n** Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinum-based regimen for management of primary disease), must have a platinum-free interval of less than 12 months, or have progressed during platinum-based therapy, or have persistent disease after a platinum-based therapy\r\n** Patients must NOT have received any non-cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease other than bevacizumab containing regimens; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic (non-cytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, up to 5 additional prior chemotherapy treatment regimens (including platinum-based chemotherapy); prior hormonal therapy is allowed, does not count towards this prior regimen requirement, and must be discontinued at least one week prior to T cell infusion; continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, up to 5 biologic/targeted therapies as part of their treatment regimen for recurrent disease (either alone or in combination with chemotherapy)
Participants are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen
Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted agents, such as bevacizumab) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for management of primary or recurrent/persistent disease (either alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy); PARP inhibitors will NOT count as a prior regimen when given alone
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, up to two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease, with no more than 1 prior non-platinum cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen\r\n* Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) therapy as part of their prior treatment; for the purposes of this study, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors will be considered â€œcytotoxic\; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, PARP inhibitors for management of primary or recurrent/persistent disease (either alone or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy); single agent hormonal therapies will not be counted as a line of treatment
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, two additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease, with no more than 1 non-platinum regimen; treatment with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent or persistent disease is NOT allowed
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted) therapy as part of their treatment for recurrent or persistent disease and/or as treatment for recurrent or persistent disease; if non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted) therapy is given alone (i.e., not in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy) it will NOT count as a prior regimen
one additional cytotoxic regimen and/or PARP inhibitor for management of recurrent or persistent disease.
biologic therapy (e.g., bevacizumab) as part of their primary treatment regimen or part of their treatment for management of recurrent or persistent disease.
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional prior treatment regimen (including a single chemotherapeutic, a combination of chemotherapeutics, or biologic drugs such as bevacizumab) for management of their recurrent or persistent disease
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary therapy and/or as part of their therapy for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease (e.g., bevacizumab)
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, three additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease; hormonal therapies will not count toward the prior regimen limit
Patients are allowed to receive, but not required to receive biologic (noncytotoxic) therapy as part of their treatment regimen, e.g. bevacizumab
Patients must not have received any non-cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease, except hormonal based therapy is allowed; patients are allowed to have previously received, but are not required to have received non-cytotoxic therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen
Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic therapy (such as bevacizumab) as part of their primary treatment regimen; patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease
