Patients in dose escalation and all expansion cohorts except first relapse AML may have received up to three prior lines of therapy.
Dose escalation and expansion cohort: HER2+ tumors documented by clinical pathology report:
To be enrolled in the dose escalation or in the MTD expansion, Subject must have a locally confirmed diagnosis of either of the following tumor types:
In the dose de-escalation cohort: subjects must have evaluable disease
For escalation, subjects must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of PPV-MF, PET-MF, or PMF as per the European Hematology Association (EHA) or World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria (note that all diagnoses must include the presence of at least grade 1 marrow fibrosis according to the European Consensus on Grading of Bone Marrow Fibrosis as well as intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high risk disease according to the International Working Group for Research and Treatment of Myelofibrosis (IWG-MRT) Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System; patients with PV may enter the trial if they meet the labeled indication for ruxolitinib (eg hydroxyurea resistant or refractory)\r\n* Escalation Stage 1: patients who have not achieved normalization of splenomegaly, who have ongoing disease related symptoms (as defined by Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score [MPN-SAF TSS]), or blood counts with at least 8 weeks of therapy with a steady dose of ruxolitinib\r\n* Escalation Stage 2: patients who have not yet received therapy with any JAK-STAT inhibitory agents or patients on at least 8 weeks of a steady dose of ruxolitinib (patients with exposure to other JAK-STAT inhibitory agents are not eligible); after discussion with the study chair or designee, patients with suboptimal response on at least 8 weeks of a steady dose of ruxolitinib may be allowed to de-escalate ruxolitinib therapy in order to enter a safety cohort which is enrolling patients at a lower dose; patients must receive the lower dose of ruxolitinib for at least 7 consecutive days without event before adding TGR-1202; if the patient completed screening evaluation including bone marrow biopsy/aspirate prior to ruxolitinib de-escalation, it need not be repeated after de-escalation provided that all evaluation occurred within 28 days prior to the first dose of TGR-1202
Dose Escalation (Segment 1): 0 - 1
NOTE: the first subject in the first dose cohort must be >= 18 years of age if an adult has not been treated at that dose cohort on the companion Stanford protocol “Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of CD19/CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells in Adults with Recurrent or Refractory B Cell Malignancies” and undergone safety evaluation at day 28 without evidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
