Documented disease progression after at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy.
Patients must have progressed (in the opinion of the treating investigator) following the most recent line of therapy
Patients must have progressed radiographically following first line platinum-based chemotherapy, no additional lines of therapy are permitted\r\n* NOTE: Prior adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage disease does not count as one line of therapy if 12 months or greater elapsed between completion of adjuvant therapy and initiation of first-line systemic therapy; if less than 12 months elapsed, adjuvant chemotherapy counts as one line of therapy\r\n* Exception for targeted therapy sub-study (Arm T): At least one line of prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy is required, but there is no limit on number of prior treatments
Patients must have either failed to achieve a complete remission, or must have relapsed within 2 years after completing first line bendamustine-containing chemoimmunotherapy (including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), as measured from the last dose of bendamustine; relapsed patients must not have received any intervening chemotherapy; patients must have received at least 3 cycles of bendamustine as first line therapy; (note that no minimum dose of bendamustine is required); patients who additionally received any maintenance anti-CD-20 antibody based therapy or consolidative radioimmunotherapy within 2 years of the last dose of the bendamustine therapy are eligible; involved field or involved site radiation is not considered a line of therapy; patients who previously received anthracycline based therapy are excluded; examples of eligible 1st line treatment regimens (note this list is not all inclusive):\r\n* Bendamustine rituximab x 4 cycles\r\n* Bendamustine bortezomib rituximab x 6 cycles followed by rituximab maintenance\r\n* Bendamustine obinutuzumab x 3 cycles
1 prior line of systemic therapy for multiple myeloma, where a line of therapy for myeloma is defined as 1 or more planned cycles of single agent or combination therapy, as well as a planned series of treatment regimens administered in a sequential manner (e.g. lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy for 4 cycles followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and then lenalidomide maintenance therapy would be considered 1 line of prior therapy); a new line of therapy begins when a planned therapy is modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of disease progression, disease relapse or treatment-related toxicity (e.g. a patient is progressing in the face of lenalidomide maintenance therapy and has bortezomib and dexamethasone added into their regimen); a new line of therapy also begins when a planned treatment-free interval is interrupted by the need to start treatment due to disease relapse/progression (e.g. a patient with relapsed myeloma achieves a partial response after a planned 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone, enjoys an 8-month period off therapy but then experiences disease progression requiring re-initiation of therapy)

For Phase 2 only, have had disease progression or be refractory or intolerant to 1 prior line of therapy (first line therapy) for recurrent or refractory for NSCLC or HCC and have refused currently approved second-line therapy. First line therapy is defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease. This may include multiple chemotherapeutic, targeted or immunotherapeutic agents with or without radiation therapy and/or surgery. Each subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease progression. A switch of an agent within the same drug class (eg, cisplatinum to carboplatinum) within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start of a new line of therapy.
For Phase 2 only, more than 1 prior line of therapy for their tumor type.
At least 1 prior line of therapy

Subjects previously treated with systemic adjuvant therapy, other than immunotherapy for recurrent advanced NSCLC, are also eligible.
Previously treated with no more than one line of prior systemic therapy for stage IIIb or IV lung cancer\r\n* For patients who have previously treated one line of prior systemic therapy for stage IIIb or IV lung cancer, they must have exhibited evidence of disease progression clinically and/or radiographically on or after that treatment\r\n* Patients who previously received neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant chemotherapy for localized NSCLC and then recurred within 6 months of completing chemotherapy will be considered as having received one line of prior therapy; patients who relapse > 6 months after completing chemotherapy as part of neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant therapy for localized disease, and thereafter receive additional one line of chemotherapy at the time of metastatic disease will be eligible\r\n* Maintenance therapy does not count as a separate line of therapy

Discontinuation of a regimen without progression (for example, due to toxicity) or a switch of an agent within the same drug class (for example from cisplatin to carboplatin) will not be considered a new line of therapy. Similarly, maintenance therapy (continuation maintenance or switch maintenance) will not be considered a new line of treatment.

This may have consisted of 1 or more planned cycles of single-agent therapy or combination therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned manner. For example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by maintenance was considered 1 line of therapy. Autologous and allogenic transplants were permitted.
