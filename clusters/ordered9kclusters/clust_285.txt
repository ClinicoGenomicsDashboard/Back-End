Significant prior external beam dose-limiting radiation to a critical organ based on review of the prior radiation treatment records by the Radiation Oncology PI; patients who have had prior external beam radiation > 2000 cGy (at 180 to 200 cGy per day) to the lung will be ineligible; patients with ANY prior radiation to the heart are ineligible; patients with > 500 cGy to the kidney will be excluded from the study; Note: patients who have had electron beam therapy are still eligible and will be evaluated on a case by case basis by the Radiation Oncology PI

Significant prior external beam dose-limiting radiation to a critical organ based on review of the prior radiation treatment records by the radiation oncology PI; patients who have had prior external beam radiation > 2000 cGy (at 180 to 200 cGy per day) to any portion of the lung will be ineligible; patients with ANY prior radiation to the heart are ineligible; patients with > 500 cGy to any portion of the kidney will be excluded from the study
Patients with no previous radiation or up to a maximum 2000 cGy to non thoracic-spine and rib bone lesions or < 20% of bone marrow are eligible for TMI conditioning regimen

Liver: 1000 cGy
Lungs: 500 cGy
Previous irradiation that precludes the safe administration of an additional dose of 200 cGy of TBI
Patients may have had prior systemic therapy without constraint on the number of prior treatment regimens except:\r\n* Patients may not have had > 450 mg/m^2 doxorubicin \r\n* Patients may not have had > 3000 centigray (cGy) to fields encompassing the entire pelvis
Patients undergoing a total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen (TBI 1200 cGy)
Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy > 200 cGy has been delivered to the target volume
Prior radiation therapy with 400 cGy or more of TBI; if 200 cGy of prior TBI then only 400 cGy of TBI on this protocol is permitted
Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy > 200 cGy has been delivered to the target volume
Patients will be ineligible if any prior therapeutic radiation therapy > 200 cGy has been delivered to the central nervous system
Previous radiation therapy to more than 20% of bone marrow containing areas, or to any area exceeding 2000 cGy, is an exclusion
Patients who have received > 500 cGy radiation to the kidneys will be excluded from the study
Patients are not eligible if they have received local radiation which includes any of the following: 1200 centigray (cGy) to more than 33% of both kidneys (patient must have at least 1 kidney that has not exceeded the dose/volume of radiation listed) or 1800 cGy to more than 30% of liver and/or 900 cGy to more than 50% of liver; emergency local irradiation is allowed prior to study entry, provided the patient still meets eligibility criteria
