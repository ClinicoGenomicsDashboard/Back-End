Creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL OR calculated (calc.) creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min
Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) mg/dL OR calculated (calc.) creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min
Creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL x upper limits of normal (ULN) OR calculated (calc.) creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min
Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR calculated (calc.) creatinine clearance > 45 mL/min using the lean body mass formula only
