Patients who have received hydroxyurea alone or have received non-cytotoxic therapies previously for treatment of MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) (e.g. azacitidine, decitabine, histone deacetylase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, hematopoietic growth factors, interferon, lenalidomide, thalidomide) will be eligible for this trial as long as immunomodulatory drugs (e.g. lenalidomide, thalidomide) have not been used in the past 3 months
Patients must be off all non-cytotoxic chemotherapies or biologic agents (e.g. azacitidine, decitabine, histone deacetylase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, hematopoietic growth factors, interferon, but excluding hydroxyurea and cyclophosphamide) for at least 2 weeks prior to starting induction chemotherapy
