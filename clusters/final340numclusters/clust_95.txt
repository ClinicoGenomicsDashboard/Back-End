Patients may have received prior anti-CTLA4 or other anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy, not both, provided that it is completed >= 4 weeks prior to registration
Patients must not have had systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy, including, but not limited to interferon alfa-2b, high dose interleukin 2 (IL-2), pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN), anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, intra-tumoral, or vaccine therapies within 6 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1; patients must not have received or be planning to receive any of the prohibited therapies during protocol treatment; prior intravesical interferon therapy is allowed
Prior experimental (non-Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) therapies and immunotherapies are allowed; patients must not have received these therapies for 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have recovery =< grade 1 from any adverse events of these therapies (other than alopecia); prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor or any anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody is NOT allowed
Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor or any anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody
There is no limit to the number of lines of prior therapy; prior anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1 or anti-PD-ligand (L)1 therapy and other immunotherapies are allowed
Prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy may not be administered after ACT and before study atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administration
Patients in both cohorts must have progressive disease following prior therapy; specifically:* Cohort 1 (NSCLC): Patients must have evidence of radiologic or clinical disease progression during previous treatment with systemic PD-1 directed therapy and/or have been deemed not to derive clinical benefit from PD-1 directed treatment; this includes patients who demonstrated an initial response and subsequent progression; no prior treatment with chemotherapy or targeted agents are required; intervening therapy is allowed between previous PD-1 directed treatment and there is no required interval from prior PD-1 treatment required; PD-1 directed treatment includes treatment with antibodies targeting the PD-1 receptor such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, as well as PD-L1 targeted antibodies such as MEDI4736 (durvalumab), atezolizumab and avelumab; these agents may have been administered as part of a clinical trial* Cohort 2 (colorectal cancer): Patients must have progressed on >= one line chemotherapy
Prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy, including durvalumab and tremelimumab, except for anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (including durvalumab) in NSCLC patients; this includes anti-CTLA-4 agents (prior treatment with these agents is NOT allowed in either cohort) and, excludes therapeutic anticancer vaccines, excluding therapeutic anticancer vaccines; exposure to other investigational agents may be permitted after discussion with the study principal investigator (PI)
Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody or pathway-targeting agents
Patients who have had prior treatment with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 therapy
Patients must not have had prior immunotherapy with anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA4 or similar drugs; patients must not be planning to receive any of the prohibited therapies during the screening or treatment phases of the study
Patients must have progressed during or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy; patients whose only prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen was for stage I-III disease (i.e. patient has not received any platinum-based chemotherapy for stage IV or recurrent disease), disease progression on platinum-based chemotherapy must have occurred within one year from the last date that patient received that therapy; patients must have experienced disease progression during or after prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody monotherapy as their most recent line of treatment; prior PD-1/PD-L1 combination therapy is not permitted
Patient must have had prior treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents and have documented disease progression on these agents prior to registration; patient must have received anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 based therapy as the immediate previous line of treatment and within 56 days prior to registration
Patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, CDK 4/6 inhibitors, or other immune-based therapy are eligible
Patients must have had prior treatment with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 agents and had documented disease progression either while on these agents or after stopping therapy with these agents without intervening therapy; patients must have discontinued anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy at least 21 days prior to registration
Patients must not have achieved a confirmed partial or complete response to the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents prior to progression
Patients must not have had systemic therapy, excluding anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents, within 21 days prior to registration
Patients must not have had:* Prior treatment with ipilimumab or other CTLA-4 antagonists* Systemic therapy between progression on the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents and registration* Note: Systemic therapy (including BRAF-targeting agents) prior to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy is allowed
