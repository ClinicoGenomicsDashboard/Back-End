Serum total bilirubin =< twice the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) within 21 days of registration on study (or within 21 days prior to day 1 of chemotherapy post-surgery for those patients having started chemotherapy prior to first step registration)
Total bilirubin within institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)
REGISTRATION #2 - PRIOR TO CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Total bilirubin =< IULN

Within 14 days prior to registration: Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)
Patients must have bilirubin =< 2 x IULN within 7 days prior to registration (unless the bilirubin is primarily unconjugated)
Serum bilirubin =< institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) within 28 days prior to sub-study registration; for patients with liver metastases, bilirubin must be =< 5 x IULN

Within 14 days prior to registration: Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)
CLINICAL/LABORATORY CRITERIA: Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN); these results must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration
