International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) =< 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy not requiring laboratory monitoring as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants; therapeutic Coumadin is not acceptable
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants
International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT): =< 1.5 X ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): =< 1.5 X ULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants
Patients must have prothrombin time (PT) / international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 2.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless the patient is on anticoagulant therapy within 28 days prior to registration (if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, PT, and a PTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)
Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x institutional ULN, unless the subject is on anticoagulant therapy; (if the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, PT, and activated PTT (aPTT) must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)
Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x institutional unless the subject is on anticoagulant therapy (if the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, PT, and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)
