Persistent toxicities (>= Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia and CTCAE grade 2 peripheral neuropathy
All prior treatment-related toxicities must be Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v 4.0) grade =< 1 (except alopecia); grade 2 prior treatment related toxicities may be allowed after discussion with the principal investigator
Any valve disease Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade
Patients with active >= Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 4 grade 2 neuropathy are ineligible
The subject has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) =< grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except alopecia and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs)
The subject has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) =< grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except alopecia and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs) defined as lab elevation with no associated symptoms or sequelae
All prior treatment-related toxicities must be Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (V) 5 grade =< 1 (except alopecia); certain exceptions apply, such as immunotherapy-induced hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency or panhypopituitarism requiring stable doses of hormone replacement or rash from prior therapy
The participant has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) =< grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except =< grade 2 alopecia, neuropathy, and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs)

PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY CRITERIA: Patients must not have received any chemotherapy, biologic agent, or any investigational agent within 14 days prior to registration. Patients must have recovered from any adverse events to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 0-1 prior to registration
Active, clinically serious infections > Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2
Nervous system disorders (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v]4) resulting from prior therapy must be =< grade 2
Patients may have received prior surgery; all adverse events associated with prior surgery must have resolved to =< grade 1 (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] 4.0) prior to registration
Patients who received prior medical therapy for a NF1 related tumor must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy to =< grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5 before entering this study
Recovered from adverse events to grade 1 or less toxicity according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE 4.0) due to agents administered previously* NOTE: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia and grade 2 neuropathy are acceptable
Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities > Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 1 or baseline, with the exception of alopecia)
Nervous system disorders (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] version 5.0) resulting from prior therapy must be =< grade 2 with the exception of decreased tendon reflex (DTR); any grade of DTR is eligible
Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment with the exception of alopecia and grade 2 platinum-therapy related neuropathy
Patients with peripheral neuropathy >= Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 are ineligible
Patients who have not recovered to < Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 toxicities related to prior therapy are ineligible
All prior treatment-related toxicities must be Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5) grade =< 1 (except alopecia) at the time of enrollment
