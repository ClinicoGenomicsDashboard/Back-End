Phase I: histologically confirmed solid tumors that have progressed on standard therapy known to prolong survival or for which no standard treatment options exist
Patients must have histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed on standard therapy that is known to be associated with a survival advantage or have disease for which there is no known standard therapy
Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for which all standard therapy known to prolong survival have failed or for which standard therapies do not exist
TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients with histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed following at least one line of standard therapy and/or no standard of treatment exists that has been shown to prolong survival
TREATMENT: Patients with histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed following at least one line of standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists that has been shown to prolong survival
Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors that have progressed on standard therapy known to prolong survival or for which no standard treatment options exist
Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors that have progressed on standard therapy known to prolong survival or for which no standard treatment options exist
Patients must have either progressed on least one standard therapy or there must be no standard treatment exists that has been shown to prolong survival for the patientï¿½s disease; patients may have received any number of prior cytotoxic agents
Patients must have histologically documented solid tumors or histologically confirmed diagnosis of lymphoma or multiple myeloma requiring therapy and meet one of the following criteria:* Patients must have progressed following at least one line of standard systemic therapy and there must not be other approval/standard therapy available that has been shown to prolong overall survival (i.e. in a randomized trial against another standard treatment or by comparison to historical controls); patients who cannot receive other standard therapy that has been shown to prolong overall survival due to medical issues will be eligible, if other eligibility criteria are met; if the patient is currently receiving therapy, the clinician must have assessed that the current therapy is no longer benefitting the patient prior to enrolling on MATCH, regardless of whether it is considered standard OR* Patients for whose disease no standard treatment exists that has been shown to prolong overall survival* NOTE: No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer; in situ cervical cancer; adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission; any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years
Patients must have histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed on standard therapy or for which there is no available standard therapy
Histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally advanced tumors for which no standard therapy exists, or where standard therapy has failed, or in patients otherwise ineligible for standard therapy, or for an indication that anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy has been shown to be effective in studies in HIV-uninfected participants; disease-specific criteria will be applied for certain common cancers and cancers strongly associated with HIV; however, enrollment will not be confined to these tumors
Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for which standard therapy known to prolong survival has failed in the metastatic setting or for which standard therapies do not exist
Patients must have progressed following at least one line of standard systemic therapy and there must not be other approved/standard therapy available that has been shown to prolong overall survival (i.e. in a randomized trial against another standard treatment or by comparison to historical controls); patients who cannot receive other standard therapy that has been shown to prolonged survival due to medical issues will be eligible, if other eligibility criteria are met; OR * Patients for whose disease no standard treatment exists that has been shown to prolong overall survival
