Willingness to undergo a tumor biopsy
Willingness to provide mandatory tissue and blood samples for correlative studies
Patients must have a minimum of five, available unstained slides from the residual (post-neoadjuvant) invasive tumor in primary site or lymph node; (these will be submitted to determine PD-L1 expression) the tumor tissue must be adequate for PD-L1 testing, which typically requires a minimum of 100 cancer cells per slide* NOTE: Initial order for specimen kits should be placed at least two weeks prior to registering the first patient at each site
Patients must be willing to submit blood and tissue specimens for translational medicine
Willingness to release archival tissue sample for research purposes, if available
Patients must have a tumor tissue form indicating availability of archived tissue from initial resection at diagnosis of GBM, completed and signed by a pathologist
Patients must have a tumor tissue form indicating availability of archived tissue from a previous surgery for glioblastoma, completed and signed by a pathologist
Patients must have blood and tissue specimens collected prior to registration and submitted for translational medicine; note that patients without adequate diagnostic specimens will not be eligible; with patient consent, residuals from the mandatory submission will be banked for future research
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block (or 16 unstained sections [charged, 4 um]) of the biopsy or curettage must be submitted along with the corresponding pathology report; patients without such material, but willing to undergo repeat biopsy or curettage, are eligible; repeat biopsy must occur after consent but prior to randomization
Patients for whom a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block (or 16 unstained sections [charged, 4 um]) of the biopsy or curettage are unavailable and patient is unwilling to undergo repeat biopsy or curettage
Patients must be offered the opportunity to submit archival tissue for translational medicine; patients must also be willing to undergo biopsies and submit fresh tissue and blood for translational medicine
Tumor tissue must be available for submission for central pathology review
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT ONTO APEC1621SC: Patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample available for MATCH study testing from a biopsy or surgery that was performed at any point after initial tumor recurrence/progression, or be planned to have a procedure to obtain such a sample that is considered to be of potential benefit by the treating clinicians; a tumor sample from a clinically performed diagnostic (pre-treatment) biopsy will be acceptable for enrollment onto pediatric MATCH for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG, brainstem gliomas)
