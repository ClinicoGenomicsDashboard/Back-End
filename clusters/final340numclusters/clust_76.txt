Patients must have recovered to at least eligibility levels due to adverse events (AEs) and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy; they must not have had chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C, or 2 months for UCN-01), or therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 5 times the half-life of the inhibitors prior to entering the study; patients must be >= 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a phase 0 study (also referred to as an �early phase I study� or �pre-phase I study� where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the principal investigator's (PI) discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities
Any prior therapy must have been completed >= 4 weeks prior to enrollment on protocol and the participant must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity; patients should be at least six weeks out from nitrosoureas and mitomycin C; prior radiation should have been completed >= 4 weeks prior to study enrollment and all associated toxicities resolved to eligibility levels; patients must be >= 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a phase 0 study (also referred to as an �early phase I study� or �pre-phase I study� where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI�s discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities
Any prior therapy must have been completed >= 4 weeks prior to enrollment on protocol and the participant must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity; patients should be at least 6 weeks out from nitrosoureas and mitomycin C; prior radiation should have been completed >= 4 weeks prior to study enrollment and all associated toxicities resolved to eligibility levels; patients must be >= 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a phase 0 study (also referred to as an �early phase I study� or �pre-phase I study� where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the principal investigator's (PI�s) discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities
No radiation, major surgery, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C); >= 2 weeks since any prior administration of study drug in an exploratory investigational new drug (IND)/phase 0 study (also referred to as an �early phase I study� or �pre-phase I study� where a subtherapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the principal investigator (PI)�s discretion; patients must have recovered to at least eligibility levels due to adverse events and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy
Patients must have recovered to at least eligibility levels following any display of adverse events and/or toxicity due to prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy; they must not have had hormonal therapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C, or 7-hydroxystaurosporin [UCN-01]); patients must be >= 2 weeks since any prior administration of study drug in a phase 0 study (also referred to as an �early phase I study� or �pre-phase I study� where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the principal investigator's (PI�s) discretion; patients must be >= 4 weeks since any prior radiation or major surgery; however, patients receiving bisphosphonates or therapeutic anticoagulation are eligible for this trial
Patients must be >= 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a phase 0 study (also referred to as an �early phase I study� or �pre-phase I study� where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the coordinating center PI�s discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities
Treatment with any other investigational agent within 4 weeks (or within five half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is shorter) prior to cycle 1, day 1 (minimum of 1 week between prior therapy and study enrollment); patients must be >= 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a phase 0 study (also referred to as an �early phase I study� or �pre-phase I study� where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the coordinating center PI�s discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities
