Subjects with symptomatic bradycardia
Participants with symptomatic bradycardia
Medically significant (symptomatic) bradycardia
Pathologic bradycardia or heart block
Symptomatic bradycardia in the absence of a pacemaker.
Current diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia
Medically significant (symptomatic) bradycardia.
History or presence of sustained bradycardia (less than or equal to 60 beats per minute [BPM]) or history of symptomatic bradycardia, left bundle branch block, cardiac pacemaker or significant atrial tachyarrhythmias, as defined by the need for treatment
