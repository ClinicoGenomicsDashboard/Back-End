The presence of known lung or liver metastases greater than 1.0 cm in the long axis diameter
The presence of lymphadenopathy greater than 3 cm in the short-axis diameter
T4, node positive or advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. Node positivity defined as nodes greater than 1cm in short axis with loss of uniform cortex/fatty hilum.
Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion above and below the diaphragm or stage 4 disease that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension; lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm, regardless of the short axis
Pancreatic target tumor diameter of ? 2.0 cm (shortest axis) to ? 6.0 cm (longest axis) and a minimum tumor volume of 14.0 cc as qualified by the central reading center
At least 1 measurable lesion according to modified RECIST Version 1.1 (non?nodal lesions must be ?1.0 cm in the long axis or ?double the slide thickness in the long axis) within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
At least 1 measurable site of disease according to Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson Criteria); the site of disease must be greater than 1.5 cm in the long axis regardless of short axis measurement or greater than 1.0 cm in the short axis regardless of long axis measurement, and clearly measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions
Lymphadenopathy exceeding 6 cm in short-axis diameter
Patients with contralateral hilar involvement (greater than 1.5 cm on short axis or positive on PET scan, or biopsy-proven)
Must have at least 1 node greater than 1.5 cm in short axis diameter
Para-aortic nodal involvement above the level of the common iliac nodes or L3/L4 (if biopsy proven, PET positive or > 15mm short axis diameter on CT)
Patients with pelvic and/or retroperitoneal lymph nodes < 1.5 cm in short axis are eligible
Have measurable disease based as defined by at least one lesion that can be measured in least 2 perpendicular dimensions and measures at least 1.5 cm in its long axis
Evidence of nodal disease greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis as these findings are concerning for metastases that would not be targeted with radium-223 alone (Arm B); however, lymph nodes with short axis measurements between 1.5-3 cm that have not enlarged more than 5mm (to account for reader variability) over the last 6 months and which are not inducing symptoms, causing obstruction, or in the opinion of the investigator pose a risk of impending obstruction of any structures, will be allowed
Para-aortic nodal involvement above the level of the common iliac nodes or L3/L4 (if biopsy proven, PET positive, or >= 15 mm short-axis diameter on computed tomography [CT])
A PET/computed tomography (CT) scan is required; patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes with short axis diameter =< 1 cm and no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0; patients with > 1 cm short axis diameter of hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or abnormal PET (including suspicious but non-diagnostic uptake) may still be eligible if directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer; solitary pulmonary lesions =< 6 mm will not be considered significant
Nonhepatic lesion c. Lymph node (LN) lesion that measures at least one dimension as greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in the short axis, except for porta hepatis LN that measures greater than or equal to 2.0 cm in the short axis d. Non-nodal lesion that measures greater than or equal to 1.0 cm in the longest diameter Lesions previously treated with radiotherapy or locoregional therapy must show radiographic evidence of disease progression to be deemed a target lesion.
Participants must have measurable disease, including at least one of the following: an absolute B cell count > 5000/uL, OR lymphadenopathy with at least one lymph node > 2 cm in long axis, OR palpable splenomegaly, OR cytopenias (hemoglobin [Hb] < 11 g/dL or platelets < 100 K) together with bone marrow infiltration
Measurable disease (NHL: At least 1 measurable site of disease [>1.5 centimeter [cm] in the long axis regardless of short axis measurement or >1.0 cm in the short axis regardless of long axis measurement, and clearly measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions])
Lymphadenopathy exceeding 3 cm in short-axis diameter
Malignant lymphadenopathy exceeding 3 cm in short-axis diameter.
Malignant lymphadenopathy with lymph nodes exceeding 3 cm in short axis diameter
Lymphadenopathy with lymph nodes exceeding 3 cm in short axis diameter
Patients with pelvic and/or retroperitoneal nodes < 2 cm in short axis are eligible as they are not considered to have definitive metastases
Baseline fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans must demonstrate positive lesions compatible with computed tomography (CT) defined anatomical tumor sites\r\n* CT scan showing at least:\r\n** 2 or more clearly demarcated lesions/nodes with a long axis > 1.5 cm and short axis >= 1.0 cm OR\r\n** 1 clearly demarcated lesion/node with a long axis > 2.0 cm and short axis >= 1.0 cm
Radiographically measurable disease, defined as: 2 or more clearly demarcated lesions/nodes with a long axis >1.5 cm and short axis ?1.0cm. OR 1 clearly demarcated lesion/node with a long axis >2.0 cm and short axis ?1.0cm.
Visceral metastases (including cerebral metastases) from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (> 2 lung and/or liver metastases [size >= 2 cm]; lymphadenopathy exceeding 6 cm in short-axis diameter or any size pelvic lymphadenopathy if it is thought to be a contributor to concurrent hydronephrosis), as assessed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or chest X-ray within the 8 weeks prior to registration
Definite evidence of metastatic prostate cancer, in the opinion of the treating physician; pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes < 2.0 cm in short axis are allowed
CT scans showing involvement of 1 or more clearly demarcated lesions with a long axis > 1.5 cm and short axis >= 1.0 cm
At least one of the brain lesions must measure 5 mm (or more) in short axis diameter in the axial plane
Lymph node (LN) lesion that measures at least one dimension as ?1.5 cm in the short axis, except for porta hepatis LN that measures ?2.0 cm in the short axis
