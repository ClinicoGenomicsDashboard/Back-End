Patient in CR or has a bone marrow failure disorder or non-malignant hematologic or immune disorder: Does NOT have a sibling donor or 12/12 HLA matched unrelated donor available OR treating clinician considers haploidentical transplant preferable (despite sibling donor availability or 12/12 HLA matched donor availability) due to patient’s clinical status
Availability of an 8 of 8 (HLA-A, B, C and DRB1) HLA matched sibling or matched unrelated donor
Recipients must have received an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or an 8/8-matched (HLA-A, B, C, DR) other-than-sibling related donors, or a 8/8-matched (HLA-A, B, C, DR) unrelated donor (URD) allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for an eligible CD30+ lymphoma
Must have no 7/8 or 8/8 HLA-matched sibling donor - patients >= 70 and =< 75 years of age may be eligible if they have a co-morbidity score =< 2

DONOR: Related donor (parents, sibling, offspring, or offspring of sibling)
DONOR:\r\n* PART 1: Donor must be a 5/6 or 6/6 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling willing to donate PBSC for transplant\r\n* PART 2: Donor must be a 5/6 or 6/6 HLA-matched sibling or >= 3/6 HLA haploidentical donor willing to donate PBSC for transplant; haploidentical donors will be allowed to participate upon investigator decision and based on the data reached from 5/6 or 6/6 HLA matched transplant done during Part 1 of the study
DONOR: HLA-matched or single allele mismatched sibling of enrolled transplant patient
Patients must be medically ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCTx) or not have a known fully HLA matched sibling for planned sibling transplant
Patients for whom an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor bone marrow transplant is being actively pursued will not be eligible for study until it is determined that no sibling donor is available or that a stem cell transplant is not feasible during the time the patient might be on study\r\n* No patient will be included in this study as an alternative to a clinically indicated HLA matched sibling donor stem cell transplant\r\n* If an HLA matched sibling donor is identified, but stem cell or marrow collection is not feasible (e.g., donor is in utero, is a newborn from whom cord blood was not collected, or is unable to undergo a donation procedure because of ill health), a patient may be included in the study at the discretion of the investigators
Patients with an available 5-6/6 HLA-A, B, DRB1 matched sibling donor
HLA-identical sibling

No 10/10 matched sibling donor available or not financially eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation
DONOR: Must be the same sibling donor from whom the recipient’s blood and marrow graft was collected for the original allogeneic transplant that is HLA 7/8 or 8/8 or haploidentical matched at the HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1

DONOR: Must be 6/6 matched sibling donor as determined by HLA typing
Identification of a HLA-matched hematopoietic cell donor without a history of a disorder that can be transmitted by hematopoietic cells, including but not limited to inflammatory bowel disease, and without nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) mutations in the case of a HLA matched sibling
DONOR: Related donors (sibling, parent, offspring, parent or offspring of an HLA identical sibling)
Matched sibling or un-related donor (A, B, C, and DR) available to undergo leukopheresis
Available HLA-haploidentical donor that meets the following criteria:\r\n* Blood-related family member (sibling [full or half], offspring, parent, cousin, niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, or grandparent) \r\n* At least 18 years of age\r\n* HLA-haploidentical donor/recipient match by at least low-resolution typing per institutional standards\r\n* In the investigator’s opinion, is in general good health, and medically able to tolerate leukapheresis required for harvesting hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)\r\n* No active hepatitis\r\n* Negative for human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\r\n* Not pregnant\r\n* NOTE: The HLA-matched sibling and HLA-matched unrelated donor cohorts are closed to enrollment
