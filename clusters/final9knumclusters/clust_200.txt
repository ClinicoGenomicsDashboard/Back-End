Patients developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplant (HSCT) (ie: marrow, peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC], or umbilical cord blood); in these cases, the HSCT donor, if EBV-seropositive, will be used as the donor of EBV-specific T-cells for adoptive immunotherapy wherever possible, because the EBV-LPD are almost invariably derived from that marrow donor; these patients will be enrolled onto protocol Institutional Review Board (IRB) # 95-024; however, if the HSCT donor is EBV seronegative or not readily available (e.g. a cord blood transplant), the patient will be a candidate to receive EBV-specific T-cells generated from a third party seropositive donor that have been generated and stored in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) bank of cryopreserved immune T-cells for adoptive cell therapy; for these patients, the third party donor derived T cells to be used will be selected primarily on the basis of 1) matching for, at least, 2 HLA antigens and 2) one restricted allele shared by the transplant donor and recipient; however, priority is given to T cells partially HLA antigen matched with, and restricted by, HLA alleles of the transplant donor, since EBV + lymphomas in HSCT recipients are usually (but not always) derived from the transplant donors' cells
DONOR: Known EBV seronegative
DONOR: The patient's HSCT donor, or if HSCT donor is not available a third party donor, must consent to a leukapheresis or whole blood donation(s) obtained at one or more phlebotomies which, in aggregate, will total approximately 250 ml for adults and no more than 5 ml/kg per draw from pediatric donors

MATCHED RELATED DONOR: A donor who is lactating must be willing and able to interrupt breast-feeding or substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of filgrastim administration and for two days following the final dose
MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: The evaluation of donors shall be in accordance with existing National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) Standard Policies and Procedures; general donor inclusion criteria specified in the NMDP Standards (22nd edition)
HAPLOIDENTICAL RELATED DONOR: At least one normal DOCK8 allele demonstrated by a CLIA-certified lab in a sibling donor
HAPLOIDENTICAL RELATED DONOR: Subjects will also undergo the Donor Health History Screen to determine donor eligibility using standard Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) criteria in the Dowling Apheresis Clinic by skilled staff in the Blood Services Section for adult patients and age-appropriate questioning when indicated for pediatric subjects
HAPLOIDENTICAL RELATED DONOR: Subjects will undergo follow-up evaluation within 1 week of donation
HAPLOIDENTICAL DONOR: HIV infection
HAPLOIDENTICAL DONOR: Chronic active hepatitis B; donor may be hepatitis core antibody positive
HAPLOIDENTICAL DONOR: Other medical contraindications that in the opinion of the PI constitute exclusion as a donor; history of prior malignancy; however, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis; the risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient

DONOR SELECTION
Donor selection criteria in decreasing order of priority:\r\n* Absence of donor-specific HLA antibodies is preferred (negative flow cytometric cross-match assay or the mean fluorescence intensity [MFI of any anti-donor HLA antibody by solid phase immunoassay < 1000); if donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies cannot be avoided, the risks will be discussed with the patient and consenting parent/guardian and options including debulking or deferring transplant will be considered\r\n* The lowest number of mismatches in the host-versus-graft direction is prioritized to minimize graft rejection\r\n* If more than one donor with the same degree of HLA match, absent or equivalent donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, and equivalent host-versus-graft allele mismatches, the following prioritization will be used:\r\n** Homozygous normal donor is preferable to heterozygote (carrier)\r\n** ABO-compatible donor is preferable to ABO-incompatible donor\r\n** Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status\r\n*** For a CMV seronegative patient, prefer a CMV seronegative donor\r\n*** For a CMV seropositive patient, prefer a CMV seropositive donor\r\n** Younger donor is preferable to older, avoiding those > 55 years of age if possible\r\n** Male donor preferred over nulliparous female donor over multiparous female donor
