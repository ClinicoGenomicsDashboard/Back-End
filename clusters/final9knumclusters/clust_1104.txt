Availability of appropriate HLA partially-matched and restricted tabelecleucel cell product
HLA-matched or partially matched (7/8 or 8/8) related or unrelated donor is available to donate
Must have two partially HLA-matched CBUs for part 1; and one partially HLA-matched CBU for part 2
Patients developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic organ transplant; in these cases, the lymphoma is usually of recipient origin; EBV-specific T-cells will be selected from the MSKCC bank expanded from an EBV-seropositive normal donor who is at least matched for 1) 2 HLA antigens and 2) one restricted allele with the EBV lymphoma; if the origin of the lymphoma is unknown, T-cells partially matched with the recipient transplant will be used, since these lymphomas are usually of host origin; using this approach to donor selection, it is expected that the EBV-specific, HLA restricted cytotoxic T-cells expanded from the HLA partially-matched donor would be able to recognize and kill lymphoma cells presenting EBV antigens in the context of an appropriate HLA restricting element; priority will be given to the use of partially matched EBV specific T cells known to be restricted by an HLA allele shared by the lymphoma (or, if known, the patient)
Partially matched related donors will be at least haploidentical (matched at >= 3 of 6 HLA A, B, DRB1 loci)
Matched sibling donor (HLA 8/8), if available, or a unrelated partially HLA matched single unit based on the following priority:\r\n* First (1st) priority: 4/6 matched unit, cell dose >= 5 x 10^7 nucleated cells/kg\r\n* Second (2nd) priority: 5/6 matched unit, cell dose >= 4 x 10^7 nucleated cells/kg\r\n* Third (3rd) priority: 6/6 matched unit, cell dose >= 3 x 10^7 nucleated cells/kg
DONOR: Donor must be related to patient and be partially (>= 3/6 antigen) HLA-matched
Patients must have a matched or partially matched UCB unit with >= 2.5 x10^7 nucleated cells/kg of recipient weight at the time of cryopreservation
Patients must have two partially HLA-matched CBUs
DONOR: Partially HLA matched family member
DONOR: donor must be related to patient and be partially (>= 3/6 antigen) HLA-matched
Patients must have one or two partially HLA-matched CBUs
DONOR: Partially HLA matched family member
Has a suitable partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (>= 3 of 6) family member donor
Availability of appropriate partially HLA-matched and restricted tabelecleucel cell product
Has a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) partially matched family member donor (HLA identical or phenotypically matched 8/8 family member donors will not be used on this protocol)
Eligible patients will have one of the following sources of donor stem cells:\r\n* Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched family member\r\n* Partially matched family member (mismatched for a single HLA locus at A, B, C or DR)\r\n* Fully HLA matched or partially mismatched unrelated marrow or peripheral blood stem cells (per institutional donor selection standards)\r\n* HLA matched or partially mismatched (at least 4/6 match at A, B, DR) cord blood
Eligible participants will only be transplanted for standard clinical indications, which include hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia, high risk lymphoma, and multiple myeloma; much less commonly there are non-malignant indications for transplants; these include aplastic anemia and severe hemoglobinopathies; no patients will be transplanted for the primary purpose of HIV eradication; patients will undergo one of the following types of transplant:\r\n* Myeloablative, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched or partially HLA-mismatched (haploidentical), alloHSCT that includes high-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy)\r\n* Nonmyeloablative, HLA matched or partially HLA-mismatched, alloHSCT that includes high-dose post-transplantation Cy
RELATED DONOR: a 5/10, 6/10, 7/10, 8/10, 9/10 or 10/10 matched (or partially matched) family donor will be required for study entry; HLA typing can be performed at any time prior to conditioning and must be performed twice on both donor and recipient
