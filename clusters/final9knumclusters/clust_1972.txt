Patients requiring chronic treatment with systemic steroid therapy, other than replacement dose steroids in the setting of adrenal insufficiency or treatment with low, stable dose of steroid (<10mg/ day prednisone or equivalent) for stable CNS metastatic disease.
Requirement for concomitant high dose corticosteroids\r\n* EXCEPTION: Patients may be on chronic steroids (maximum dose 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent) if they are being given for adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc
REGISTRATION TO TREATMENT (STEP 1): No current use of corticosteroids; EXCEPTION: Low doses of steroids (< 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent dose of other steroid) used for treatment of non-hematologic medical condition (e.g. chronic adrenal insufficiency) is permitted
REGISTRATION TO TREATMENT (STEP 2): No current use of corticosteroids; EXCEPTION: Low doses of steroids (< 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent dose of other steroid) used for treatment of non-hematologic medical condition (e.g. chronic adrenal insufficiency) is permitted
Concomitant high dose corticosteroids except patients may be on chronic steroids (maximum dose 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent) if they are being given for disorders other than myeloma, e.g. adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc
Requirement for other concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered to be investigational or which would be considered as a treatment of AL amyloidosis. However, participants may be on chronic steroids (maximum dose 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) if they are being given for disorders other than amyloidosis (eg, adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.).
Planned concurrent treatment with systemic high dose corticosteroids; patients may be on a stable low dose of steroids (< 10 mg equivalent of prednisone) for chronic respiratory conditions
No current use of corticosteroids; EXCEPTION: low doses of steroids (< 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent dose of other steroid) used for treatment of non-hematologic medical condition (e.g. chronic adrenal insufficiency) is permitted
Concomitant high dose corticosteroids other than what is part of treatment protocol (concurrent use of corticosteroids); EXCEPTION: patients may be on chronic steroids (maximum dose 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent) if they are being given for disorders other than myeloma, i.e., adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc
Ongoing therapy with chronic or high dose corticosteroids. Low dose steroids (i.e. prednisone ? 10 mg or an equivalent steroid dose), inhaled and topical steroids are permitted
Concomitant high dose corticosteroids (concurrent use of corticosteroids); EXCEPTION: patients may be on chronic steroids (maximum dose 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent) if they are being given for disorders other than amyloid, i.e., adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.
Other concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational; NOTE: Bisphosphonates are allowed while on protocol treatment; patients may be receiving stable doses of corticosteroids with a maximum dose of 10 mg of prednisone per day if they are being given for disorders other than lymphoma such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica or adrenal insufficiency, or asthma
Concomitant high dose corticosteroids (concurrent use of corticosteroids) while on single agent ibrutinib; EXCEPTION: patients may be on chronic steroids (maximum dose 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent) if they are being given for disorders other than amyloid, (i.e., adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, etc)
