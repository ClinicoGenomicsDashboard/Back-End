On anticoagulation and unable to discontinue temporarily
Requires therapeutic doses of anticoagulants unless anticoagulation can be safely discontinued before surgery per standard practice (e.g. first deep vein thrombosis [DVT] for which anticoagulation has been at least 3 months and repeat imaging demonstrates resolution of DVT) or an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter can be used in place of anticoagulation; subjects are permitted to resume anticoagulation following surgery per discretion of treating physician and/or site standard operating procedures (SOPs)
Require therapeutic use of anticoagulation medications
Patients on therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation will be excluded from enrollment on the protocol; however, patients can remain on the study if they develop a thrombosis that requires therapeutic anticoagulation during the course of protocol therapy
Subject is actively on anticoagulation therapy.
