Patients must have confirmed expression of NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry or quantigene analysis. (This determination will be made under a pre-enrollment screening ICF)
Patient's tumor must be positive by histological assay for NY-ESO-1?Â²??T, according to the screening algorithm as described in Section 3.3.1. Positive expression is defined as ? 50% of cells that are 2+ and/or 3+ by immunohistochemistry

Tumor expression of NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen by IHC or RT-PCR, or evidence of seropositivity to NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1.
Prior exposure to NY-ESO-1 vaccine.
Positive NY-ESO-1 expression by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be required for entry, as determined by analysis at the trial central laboratory
Previous administration of vaccine therapy targeting NY-ESO-1
Patients must express NY-ESO-1 in their tumor by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (> 5%) prior to leukapheresis
Tumor expression of NY-ESO-1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)
Patients may have received previous NY-ESO-1 vaccine therapy
NY-ESO-1 expression in tumor by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is not required prior to screening consent; however, patients must have NY-ESO-1 expression to proceed with the leukapheresis; additionally patients must also meet the following criteria to proceed with leukapheresis (any exceptions to this will require prior approval by the Apheresis director and Principal Investigator):
NY-ESO-1 positive by IHC (for this study, even a small level of positivity is acceptable); for patients with < 5% NY-ESO-1 by IHC positivity, the level of staining should be discussed with the patient and they should be informed that this will likely effect the efficacy of the therapy; this conversation must be documented in the patient's medical chart
Patients must have NY-ESO-1 specific cells already produced or in production; these cells may be either in the process of their final expansion (for fresh infusion) or expanded and frozen at the time of enrollment
Patients for whom we are unable to generate NY-ESO-1 specific cells
Subject's tumor (either the most recent archival specimen or a fresh biopsy) shows positive NY-ESO-1 expression defined as ?30% of cells that are 2+ or 3+ by immunohistochemistry. All samples must have been pathologically reviewed by an Adaptimmune designated central laboratory.
Patients must have proven positive tumor sample for NY-ESO-1 as follows:
Cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) specific T cell therapy within 1 year of starting on the trial
