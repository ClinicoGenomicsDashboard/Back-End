Patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 8 weeks prior to registration to screening step and must meet the following cardiac criteria:\r\n* Resting corrected QT interval (QTc) =< 480 msec\r\n** NOTE: If the first recorded QTc exceeds 480 msec, two additional, consecutive ECGs are required and must result in a mean resting QTc =< 480 msec; it is recommended that there are 10-minute (+/- 5 minutes) breaks between the ECGs\r\n* The following only need to be assessed if the mean QTc > 480 msec\r\n** Check potassium and magnesium serum levels\r\n** Correct any identified hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia and may repeat ECG to confirm exclusion of patient due to QTc\r\n** For patients with heart rate (HR) 60-100 beats per minute (bpm), no manual read of QTc is required\r\n** For patients with baseline HR < 60 or > 100 bpm, manual read of QT by trained personnel is required, with Fridericia correction applied to determine QTc\r\n** Patient must not have hypokalemia (value < institutional lower limit of normal)\r\n* No factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events such as heart failure, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval\r\n** NOTE: Patient must be taken off prohibited medication prior to registration to the screening step (Step 0, 2, 4, 6) and remain off these medications thereafter, unless permitted on a subprotocol for the management of treatment related toxicity; patient must be off the drug for at least 5 half-lives prior to registration to the treatment step (Step 1, 3, 5, 7); the medication half-life can be found in the package insert for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs
