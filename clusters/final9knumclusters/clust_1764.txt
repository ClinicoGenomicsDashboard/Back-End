Measurable disease (at least one measurable lesion) IS required; a measurable lesion is one that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be > 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or > 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be > 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
Patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined by RECIST (version 1.1); measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer who experienced recurrence or progression within 12 months after completion of platinum based chemotherapy; patients must have measurable disease or detectable disease: \r\n* Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT, PET/CT or MRI\r\n* Detectable disease in a patient is defined as one who does not have measurable disease, but has at least one of the following conditions: \r\n** Baseline values of cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) at least 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) \r\n** Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor \r\n** Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, immune-related response criteria (irRC) for target lesions
Participants must have measurable disease defined as at least one target lesion that has not been irradiated and can be accurately measured in at least one dimension by RECIST v1.1 criteria.
At least 1 measurable Target Lesion that can be accurately measured by calipers or computed tomography (CT) consisting of:
Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension according to RECIST 1.1
Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension; each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
Measurable disease criteria as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or greater than or equal to 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
All patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be > 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
Have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. \r\n* Measurable disease is defined at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each “target” lesion must be >= 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or >= 10 mm when measured by spiral CT\r\n* Patients with non-measurable but evaluable solid tumors may be deemed eligible contingent upon principal investigator (PI) review
Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension by RECIST criteria version (v)1.1
Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as >= 10 mm with MRI, performed within 30 days prior to study registration
