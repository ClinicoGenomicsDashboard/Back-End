Relapsed/refractory MCL: Platelet count >= 30,000/mm^3 (transfusion to reach platelet count allowed); (patients who have bone marrow infiltration by MCL are eligible if their platelet level is equal to or > than 15,000/mm^3; these patients should be discussed with either the PI or Co-PI of the study for final approval)
Newly diagnosed MCL: Platelet count > 50,000/mm^3; patients who have bone marrow infiltration by MCL are eligible if their platelet level is equal to or > than 15,000 /mm^3; (platelet transfusions are allowed; these patients should be discussed with either the PI or Co-PI of the study for final approval)

Thrombocytopenia:\r\n* Defined as platelet count < 100,000/mcL\r\n* The patient will have had at least 2 complete blood counts (CBC) with platelet counts < 100,000/mcL separated by at least 4 weeks, and no platelet count >= 100,000/mcL in the prior 6 week period, despite (1) delay or (2) modification of chemotherapeutic regimen\r\n* A platelet count of > 100,000/mcL, that follows within 7 days of a platelet transfusion, will not make the patient ineligible, as long as one or more subsequent platelet counts confirms thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mcL)\r\n* Patients have undergone bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, or peripheral blood test in the prior 3 months, without evidence of leukemia or myelodysplasia by fluorescent in situ-hybridization (FISH)\r\n* Dysplastic changes, based on morphology only, will not exclude the patient if FISH panel for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is normal
Platelet count >= 100,000/mcL
Platelet count >= 50,000/mcL
Platelet count <75,000/mcL.
