FOR ALL PHASES (Ib AND II): Proteinuria of >= Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 as estimated by urine protein : creatinine ratio > 3.5 on a random urine sample
Persistent proteinuria >= grade 3 per NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (> 3.5 g/24 hours [hrs], measured by urine protein: creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)
Persistent proteinuria >= grade 3 NCI-CTCAE version (v) 4.0 (> 3.5 g/24 hours [hrs], measured by urine protein: creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)

REGORAFENIB EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Persistent proteinuria >= grade 3 (> 3.5 g/24 hours [hrs], measured by urine protein:creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)
Proteinuria =< grade 1 (ie, =< 1+ [30 mg/dL] using a random urine sample or < 1.0 gm using a 24-hour sample)\r\n* Note: if urine sample indicates >= grade 2 proteinuria (ie, 2+ [100 mg/dL]), a 24-hour urine sample must be collected and tested; urine protein in the 24-hour sample must be < 1.0 gm/24 hours
Persistent proteinuria >= grade 3 NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (> 3.5 g/24 hrs, measured by urine protein:creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)
Proteinuria =< 2+ (100 mg/dL) using a random urine sample or < 3.0 gm using a 24-hour sample; Note: If urine sample indicates >= 2+ [100 mg/dL]), a 24-hour urine sample must be collected and tested; urine protein in the 24-hour sample must be < 3.0 gm/24 hours
Proteinuria of CTCAE grade 3 or higher (estimated by urine protein: creatinine ratio >= 3.5 on a random urine sample); patients who recently (i.e., at least 30 days prior to registration) discontinued an anti-angiogenic therapy which caused proteinuria (ie, grade 2 (> 2 to > 3 g of protein or 1-3.5 g/24 hours [h]) or grade 3 proteinuria (> 4 of protein or > 3.5 g/24 h) are not eligible for enrollment until proteinuria improves to < 2 g of protein per 24 h
Proteinuria >= grade 3 (> 3.5 g/24 hours, measured by urine protein: creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)

Persistent proteinuria >= grade 3 NCI-CTCAE v4.0 (> 3.5 g/24 hours [hrs], measured by urine protein:creatinine ratio on a random urine sample)
Persistent proteinuria ? Grade 3 NCI CTCAE v4.0 as defined as > 3.5 g/24 hours, measured by urine protein: creatinine ratio on a random urine sample.
