Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders within the past 3 years prior to the start of treatment
History of active autoimmune disorders
History of or active autoimmune disorders
Patients must satisfy the criteria for a diagnosis of one of the severe neurological autoimmune disorders outlined
Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.
Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement. Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also excluded. The following will not be exclusionary:\r\n* The presence of laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease (e.g. positive antinuclear antibodies [ANA] titer) without symptoms.\r\n* Clinical evidence of vitiligo.\r\n* Hypothyroidism of any etiology on stable thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\r\n* Other forms of depigmenting illness.\r\n* Mild arthritis requiring nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) medications.
Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Subjects who developed autoimmune disorders, of Grade ? 3 may enroll if the disorder has resolved to Grade ?1 and the subject has been off systemic steroids at doses >10 mg/day, for the treatment of the autoimmune disorder, for at least 2 weeks.
Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders
Patients with autoimmune disorders or history of organ transplantation who require immunosuppressive therapy
Uncontrolled autoimmune disorders. Patients with autoimmune disorders under control on medication may be included. Patients with pure red cell aplasia may be included if hemoglobin levels are relatively stable on transfusions or medication
History of autoimmune disorders with the exception of vitiligo or autoimmune thyroid disorders
Autoimmune disorders on current immunosuppressive therapy
Patients must not have a history of, or currently active autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement
Any prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement
Patients must not have a history of, or currently active autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement
Active/prior autoimmune of inflammatory disorders
Autoimmune disorders on current immunosuppressive therapy
History of autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement; active or inactive auto-immune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, moderate or severe psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) requiring treatment\r\n* The following will not be exclusionary:\r\n** Vitiligo, thyroiditis or eczema requiring systemic steroids at a dose =< 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; individual cases can be discussed with the principal investigator
Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement; participants must not have an active or inactive autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, moderate or severe psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.); participants who are receiving therapy for an autoimmune or inflammatory disease requiring these therapies are also excluded
Autoimmune disorders and other diseases that compromise or impair the immune system.
No history of autoimmune disorders
Known clinically significant autoimmune disorders requiring on-going systemic immune-suppression for control
Patients on immunosuppressive therapy or with immune system disorders, including autoimmune disease
Subjects with any major autoimmune diseases or autoimmune disorders requiring systemic iv/oral steroids or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies.
Autoimmune disorders confined to the skin (e.g. psoriasis) are eligible, and topical steroids are allowed for the treatment of such skin disorders.
Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders within the past 3 years.
Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders within the past 3 years prior to the start of treatment
Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders;
Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders;
Patients with existing autoimmune disorders (IL-2 and GM-CSF carry a theoretical clinical risk of exacerbating underlying autoimmune disorders)

Diagnosis of autoimmune disorders
Clinically significant autoimmune disorders requiring on-going systemic immune-suppression for control
Active or history of autoimmune disorders/conditions.
Known clinically significant autoimmune disorders requiring systemic immunosuppression for control
Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Subjects who developed autoimmune disorders of Grade ? 3 may enroll if the disorder has resolved to Grade ?1 and the subject has been off systemic steroids at doses >10 mg/day for at least 2 weeks.
