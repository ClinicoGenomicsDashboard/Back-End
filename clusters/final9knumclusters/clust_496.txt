Steroid-Refractory/Dependent aGVHD (ARM 2)\r\n* Pediatric or adult HCT recipient with grade II-IV steroid refractory or steroid-dependent acute GVHD, defined as any one of the following:\r\n** No response of acute GVHD after at least 4 days of systemic corticosteroids of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent\r\n** Progression of acute GVHD within 3 days of systemic corticosteroids of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent\r\n** Failure to improve to at least grade II acute GVHD after 14 days of systemic corticosteroids, with initial doses of at least 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent\r\n** Flare of acute GVHD of at least grade II/IV severity while on steroids at a dose > 0.1/mg/kg/day; this can include late-onset aGVHD and overlap syndrome
Patients receiving high dose opioids on a chronic basis (greater than or equivalent to 60 mg of morphine per day)
Patients requiring high doses of glucocorticosteroids (>= 0.3 mg/kg prednisone or its equivalent)
Receiving anastrozole (1 mg) or letrozole (2.5 mg) orally once a day, for >= 21 days prior to registration and plan to continue throughout the duration of study
Steroid dependent/refractory cGVHD defined as:\r\n* Steroid dependent disease: Persistent cGVHD manifestations requiring a glucocorticoid dose >= prednisone 0.25 mg/kg/day (0.5 mg/kg orally [po] every other day) for at least 12 weeks\r\n* Steroid refractory disease: Progressive cGVHD manifestations despite treatment with a glucocorticoid dose >= prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day (1 mg/kg po every other day) for at least 4 weeks
Cancer patients with severe pain (i.e., >= 7 on NRS) already on opioid therapy for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of oral morphine/day, 25 mcg of transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg of oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid
Patients using >= 20 mg/day of prednisone (or steroid equivalent dose) for any chronic medical condition
Patients must have steroid refractory chronic (c) GVHD, defined as having persistent signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD despite the use of prednisone at >= 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least 2 weeks in the preceding 12 months (or equivalent dosing of alternate corticosteroids) without complete resolution of signs and symptoms, or if not responding to any lines of therapy beyond steroids, or if the MD feels adding/increasing steroids would not be in the patient’s best interest
Ongoing prednisone requirement > 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)
Participants must have steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD); steroid-refractory cGVHD is defined as having persistent signs and symptoms of cGVHD despite the use of prednisone at >= 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks (or equivalent dosing of alternate glucocorticoids) without complete resolution of signs and symptoms; participants with either extensive chronic GVHD or limited chronic GVHD requiring systemic therapy are eligible
Ongoing prednisone requirement > 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)
Acute GVHD must be corticosteroid refractory as defined by:\r\n* Progressive GVHD after at least 3 days on corticosteroids (>= 1 mg/kg of prednisone or equivalent); this means new organ involvement (skin, liver, or intestine) or increased organ specific symptoms sufficient to increase the organ stage by one or more\r\n* No improvement in GVHD after at least 7 days on corticosteroids (>= 1 mg/kg of prednisone or equivalent) OR insufficient improvement which warrants the addition of another systemic agent at the opinion of the treating investigator\r\n* GVHD during taper of corticosteroids which is unable to be tapered below 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent or, in the opinion of the treating physician, requires addition of another systemic agent
Patients must have steroid refractory classic cutaneous, myofascial, or sclerodermatous cGVHD (+/- other organ involvement, clinically diagnosed), defined as having persistent signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD despite the use of prednisone at >= 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks in the preceding 12 months (or equivalent dosing of alternate corticosteroids) without complete resolution of signs and symptoms or if not improving on any line of therapy beyond steroids or if treating physician feels that increasing or adding steroids is not in the patient’s best interests; note that the dose of systemic steroids can certainly be lower than 0.25 mg/kg/day at enrollment
Ongoing prednisone requirement > 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)
Patients who have not shown a satisfactory response to methylprednisolone-equivalent doses at 2 mg/kg/day, based on adjusted body weight
Patients with steroid refractory chronic GVHD are defined as having persistent signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD despite the use of prednisone at >= 0.5 mg/kg/day for at least 2 weeks in the preceding 24 months (or equivalent doses of alternate corticosteroids) without complete resolution of signs and symptoms
Requires immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroid therapy (> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for >= 2 weeks prior to registration
