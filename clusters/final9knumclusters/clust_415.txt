Of the five major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, 3A4 (BFC) may be involved in Phase I metabolism of PLX3397, with possibly cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2) playing a minor role; until information regarding exposure toxicity and exposure-response relationships are available with PLX3397, concomitant strong cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors and inducers are not permitted in the event they alter the systemic exposure to PLX3397; these include anticonvulsants, mycin antimicrobials, and antiretrovirals; some common examples include inhibitors such as erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, and inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, and nevirapine; concomitant treatment is permitted if the medication is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of the study drug; during the study, if the use of any concomitant treatment becomes necessary (e.g., for treatment of an adverse event), the treatment must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF), including the reason for treatment, generic name of the drug, dosage, route, and start and stop dates of administration; sirolimus undergoes extensive hepatic and intestinal metabolism via CYP3A4 and cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5), as well as excretion by permeability (P)-glycoprotein; strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole or grapefruit juice are not permitted; patients should be monitored for supratherapeutic toxic levels of sirolimus and PLX3397; as bone marrow suppression including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving sirolimus monotherapy, these adverse effects may be exacerbated in combination with PLX3397 for which patients will be closely monitored
