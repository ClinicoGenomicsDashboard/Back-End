Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein / creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Has greater than 1+ proteinuria on a urine dipstick or equivalent routine laboratory analysis will require further testing with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR); UPCR must be calculated as follows: UPCR = protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL); if the UPCR >= 1, then the patient will not be eligible for study entry; however, if urinalysis or equivalent routine laboratory analysis shows no protein, then UPCR testing is not required
Obtained within 28 days prior to the first dose of cabozantinib: urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1.
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment: Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein/ creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine Protein to Creatinine Ratio (uPCR) < 2.0
Urine protein creatine ratio (UPCR) < 1 prior to enrollment
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Within 4 days prior to the first dose of cabozantinib: Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Within 7 days before the first dose of cabozantinib: Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1 on spot urinalysis or protein =< 500 mg/24 hour urine
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) < 1 or a 24-hour urine protein collection < 1 gm within 10 days prior to registration
This criterion applies only to the patients enrolled before August 29, 2011 and those enrolled after this date electing to receive bevacizumab; patients must have a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) < 1.0 mg/dL
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 2
Has greater than 1+ proteinuria on a urine dipstick or equivalent routine laboratory analysis will require further testing with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR); if the UPCR >= 1, then the patient will not be eligible for study entry; however, if urinalysis or equivalent routine laboratory analysis shows no protein, then UPCR testing is not required
The urine protein: creatinine ratio (UPCR) is derived as follows: protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL); patients must have a UPCR < 1.0 to allow participation in the study
Urinary protein =< 1+ obtained =<14 days prior to randomization\r\n* Patients discovered to have >= 2+ proteinuria must have a spot urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) < 1.0
If UPCR ratio >= 1, collection of 24-hour urine measurement of urine protein is recommended
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 2
Urine protein/urine creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urinalysis urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) < 1 or < 1000 mg protein/24 hour (hr)
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR): < 1.0
Patients with greater than 1+ proteinuria on a urine dipstick or equivalent routine laboratory analysis will require further testing with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR); UPCR must be calculated as follows: UPCR = protein concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL); if the UPCR >= 1 then the patient will not be eligible for study entry; however, if urinalysis or equivalent routine laboratory analysis shows no protein, then UPC testing is not required
Patients with clinically significant proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by urine protein:creatinine (UPCR) ratio >/= 1.0 at screening. The UPCR has been found to correlate directly with the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection. Specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine collection. Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a 24 hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine levels [separate requests].
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 2
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 1 urinalysis or total urine protein > 500 mg/24 hours (h)
Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1
Urine protein should be screened by urinalysis for urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR); for UPCR > 1, a 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be < 500 mg
Patients with clinically significant proteinuria; urine protein should be screened by urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR); patients must have a UPCR < 1.0 to allow participation in the study
