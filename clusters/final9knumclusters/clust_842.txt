DLCO/VA and FEV1 ? 50% of predicted on PFTs.
Pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1 and corrected DLCO) > 50% predicted.
Subjects must have adequate lung function to permit surgical resection determined by pre-enrollment pulmonary function tests to include diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) as follows:\r\n* DLCO >= 70% predicted OR DLCO < 70% but >= 55% with an oxygen consumption (VO2) max >= 10 L/min/kg (assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing) or 6 minute walk test >= 500 meters\r\n* Subjects with a DLCO < 55% are excluded from this study\r\n* Subjects must have a baseline oxygen (O2) saturation by pulse oximetry that is >= 92% both at rest and while walking, off supplemental oxygen
Pulmonary: FEV 1, FVC, DLCO (diffusion capacity) ? 50% predicted (corrected for hemoglobin)
DLCO corrected < 50%; patients who are unable to perform pulmonary function tests (for example, due to young age and/or developmental status) will be excluded if the O2 saturation is < 92% on room air; patients with a DLCO 50-60% must also have a partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of > 80 mmHg
Adequate pulmonary function, defined as ? grade 1 dyspnea and SaO2 ? 92% on room air; if PFTs are performed based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician, patients with FEV1 ? 50% of predicted and DLCO (corrected) of ? 40% of predicted will be eligible
GROUP 2:\r\n* Progressive pulmonary disease as defined by a decrease in the FVC or DLCO-adjusted by 10 or 15 percent or greater, respectively, from a prior FVC or DLCO-adjusted in the previous 18-month period\r\n* Patients will have diffuse cutaneous disease and may have both FVC and DLCOcorr >= 70% at screening for the study\r\n* Patients must also have evidence of alveolitis as defined by abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
Pulmonary dysfunction defined as:\r\n* Severe pulmonary dysfunction with (1) a hemoglobin corrected DLCO < 40% of predicted at the Baseline Screening visit, or (3) FVC < 45% of predicted Baseline Screening visit, or\r\n* Partial pressure (pO2) < 70 mmHg or pCO2 >= 45 mmHg without supplemental oxygen, or \r\n* O2 saturation < 92% at rest without supplemental oxygen as measured by forehead pulse oximeter
DLCO =< 60%
EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH NSCLC OR TNBC (COHORT B): Patients with clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, as determined by medical history and physical exam should undergo pulmonary function testing; those with an FEV1 of =< 65% or DLCO (corrected) < 40% will be excluded
EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TNBC: Patients with clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, as determined by medical history and physical exam should undergo pulmonary function testing; those with an FEV1 of =< 65% or DLCO (corrected) < 40% will be excluded

RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must have FEV1/FVC > 60% by pulmonary function test (PFT), unless due to large mediastinal mass from HL; carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO), FEV1, and FVC all > 50% predicted value; all pulmonary function tests must be obtained within one month prior to registration
DLCO ? 40% predicted with no symptomatic pulmonary disease. If DLCO is ?35% and < 40% and the patient is asymptomatic, a pulmonary consult is required
FEV1 and corrected DLCO of 35% or > of predicted.
DLCO > 50%
Pulmonary function tests (PFT)s > 50% of predicted
Severely impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO (corrected for Hgb)\n             that is <50% of the normal predicted value and/or O2 saturation <88% at rest on room\n             air.
Poor pulmonary function: \r\n* For patients receiving a TBI based preparative regimen: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (corrected for hemoglobin [Hgb]) =< 60% by pulmonary function tests (PFTs)\r\n* For patients receiving a non-TBI based preparative regimen: FEV1, FVC, and DLCO =< 50% predicted (corrected for hemoglobin) for patients who have not received thoracic or mantle irradiation\r\n* For patients who have received thoracic or mantle irradiation, FEV1 and FVC < 70% predicted or DLCO =< 50 of predicted; for children unable to perform PFTs because of developmental stage pulse oximetry =< 92% on room air (RA): no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance\r\n* For children who are unable to cooperate for PFTs, required criteria are: no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and not requiring supplemental oxygen therapy
Diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) adjusted for hemoglobin >= 60% predicted, except if related to high volume metastatic GCT to the lungs, in which case there is no minimum DLCO requirement; in some cases, patients may not be able to undergo pulmonary function test (PFT) testing due to the severity of their presentation, such as those with high volume lung metastases or tumor-related pain (from large mediastinal masses, pleural disease, etc.) limiting their ability to complete PFTs; even when PFTs can be completed in these cases, patients will still be eligible if the low DLCO can be attributed directly to the patient's disease (e.g. large mediastinal mass) rather than intrinsic lung disease; since there is no minimum DLCO for these patients, under these extraordinary circumstances, this will be allowed; most patients in this situation will be expected to receive disease-stabilizing chemotherapy; an unadjusted DLCO may be used in place of the DLCO adjusted for hemoglobin in certain situations as per institutional policy; for example, MSKCC policy is to not adjust the DLCO for hemoglobin when the hemoglobin is >= 14.6 g/dL for males and >= 13.4 g/dL for females; in these cases, the unadjusted DLCO must be >= 60% predicted
DLCO > 50 percent predicted
Inadequate pulmonary function with mechanical parameters < 40% predicted (FEV1, FVC, TLC, DLCO).
Patients must be considered a candidate for surgical resection of the primary tumor; standard justification for deeming a patient medically operable based on pulmonary function for surgical resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may include any of the following: baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) > 40% predicted, post-operative predicted FEV1 > 30% predicted, diffusion capacity > 40% predicted, absent baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, exercise oxygen consumption > 50% predicted, absent severe pulmonary hypertension, absent severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease, and absent severe chronic heart disease
FEV1 < 65% predicted, FVC < 65% of predicted, DLCO (corrected for hemoglobin [Hgb]) < 50% predicted); pulmonary function tests (PFTs) within 4 months prior to consent for Step I will be required for patients with underlying risk factors such as smoking history > 10 pack years, or a history of pre-existing symptomatic lung disease (not including melanoma metastases to the lung)
