Patients must have measurable disease at baseline and 3 or fewer discrete, extracranial metastatic disease sites that are technically amenable to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or resection (at least one disease site must be amenable to radiation); some examples of what constitutes specific radiation treatment sites defining distinct metastatic disease sites are as follows: a) A lesion in each adrenal gland represents 2 of 3 sites of metastatic disease allowed to be treated on protocol; b) Similarly to NRG study RTOG 0631, disease in 2 contiguous vertebral bodies (with up to 6 cm of paraspinal extension) can represent one site of disease in the spine; non-contiguous lesions in vertebral bodies separated by one vertebral body free of disease should be viewed as 2 sites of treatment; and c) Two lesions in such close proximity to one another that treatment with one isocenter is more accurate and safer in the liver, lungs, or other similar anatomic locations should be viewed as one site of metastatic disease treatment.
