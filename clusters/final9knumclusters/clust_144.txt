Patients with Stage IIIB/IV squamous or non-squamous NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th Edition Staging) who have had prior treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab will be enrolled in one of 3 parallel cohorts based on the following:\r\n* Cohort 1: patient with progressive disease on nivolumab or pembrolizumab as the BOR; progressive disease must be confirmed with a confirmatory scan ? 4 weeks after the 1st documented date of progression\r\n* Cohort 2: patients with stable disease as the BOR on a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab\r\n* Cohort 3: patients with partial or complete response as the BOR, followed by progressive disease, on nivolumab or pembrolizumab; a confirmatory scan at the time of disease progression must be performed ? 4 weeks after the 1st documented date of progression
