Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)
Blood counts performed within 28 days prior to randomization must meet the following criteria:
There are no minimum hematological parameter requirements prior to the first two cycles, as patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are understood to have low ANC and platelet counts when the disease is active; however, patients with white blood cell (WBC) greater than 50,000 will receive hydroxyurea to reduce the WBC count to below 50,000 at which point they may begin treatment
WBC counts > 2500/µL
Platelet counts ?75 x 10^9/L
Anti-cancer agents not known to be myelosuppressive (eg, not associated with reduced platelet or absolute neutrophil counts): ?7 days after the last dose of agent
Subjects who received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy <14 days prior to their first day of study drug administration. (Hydroxyurea is allowed for up to 28 days after the start of AG-221 for the control of peripheral leukemic blasts in subjects with white blood cell [WBC] counts >30,000/?L as well as prior to enrollment).
Within 8 weeks of randomization: Absolute neutrophil counts >= 1,500 cell/mm^3
WBC counts 2500/mL
The participant has adequate organ and blood cell counts
Marrow involvement less than 25% at transplantation, no limitation on blood counts (low platelet count allowed)
Subject has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood counts at screening (obtained ? 14 days prior to starting Cycle 1 Day 1):
Adequate white blood cell counts (with low blast counts), liver function, and renal function
No prior therapy for AML except hydroxyurea to control counts
Platelet count ? 100,000 plts/mm3 (without transfusion); ? 75,000 plts/mm3 for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma only. For hematologic malignancy patients blood counts cited above do not apply
Patients may receive hydroxyurea, low-dose cytarabine and/or glucocorticoids to control peripheral blood leukemic cell counts at study entry
