Patients must have a creatinine clearance >= 30 ml/min within 28 days of registration to be eligible for the study; this will be determined by Cockroft-Gault calculation and 24-hour urine creatinine clearance measurement (please note, renal function, measured by 24-hour urine creatinine clearance in screening and post operatively, are required)

Subject must have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min; determined via urine collection for 24-hour creatinine clearance or by the Cockcroft Gault formula. Note: Investigators should consider measuring a 24-hour creatinine clearance for subjects who are morbidly obese, have fluctuating renal function, or who in the investigator's clinical judgment may yield a more accurate clearance when measured than when calculated.
