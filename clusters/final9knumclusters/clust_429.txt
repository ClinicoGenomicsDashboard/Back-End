Prior use of an HPV vaccine  \r\n* Women in the vaccine-eligible age range cannot have received vaccine prior to enrollment, but will be offered HPV vaccination at the end of the study; in brief, we are interested in the efficacy of intervention in preventing HPV in the absence of HPV vaccination, since most women worldwide who might utilize intervention will not have been vaccinated; this includes United States (US) women in the vaccine “catch-up” 19-26 year old age group (beyond the age groups eligible for Vaccines for Children- funded vaccination) who have so far had very low (< 10%) vaccine uptake; it also includes the entire group of US women > 26 years of age; moreover, it includes women of all ages in developing countries, who most need an HPV prevention strategy, but may never be vaccinated; it should be noted that delaying vaccination in women 19-26 years of age by one year is safe and reasonable, since there is insufficient data to establish a recommendation for or against universal vaccination in this age group as concluded by an American Cancer Society expert panel, which includes the Principal Investigator (PI) of this protocol, Dr. Mark Einstein; it is anticipated that if the intervention gel is efficacious, HPV vaccinated women would need to be studied in a similar future trial with power analysis taking into account vaccine effectiveness as well
