Patients must be disease-free of other prior invasive malignancies for >= 5 years with the exception of curatively-treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix; prior early stage breast cancers are also allowed as long as prior treatment did not include aromatase inhibitors
Patients with previous or concomitant non-breast invasive malignancy; exceptions are limited exclusively to patients with the following previous malignancies, if adequately treated: basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ non-breast carcinoma, contra- or ipsilateral in situ breast carcinoma, stage Ia carcinoma of the cervix
History of other clinically active malignancies within 5 years, except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous carcinoma of the skin.
