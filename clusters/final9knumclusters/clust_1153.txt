HIV-1 infection, as documented by any federally approved, licensed HIV rapid test performed in conjunction with screening (or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], test kit, and confirmed by Western blot or other approved test); alternatively, this documentation may include a record demonstrating that another physician has documented the participant's HIV status based on either: 1) approved diagnostic tests, or 2) the referring physician's written record that HIV infection was documented, with supporting information on the participant’s relevant medical history and/or current management of HIV infection

Known HIV infection.
Known history of HIV infection. Testing for HIV status is not necessary unless clinically indicated
HIV or HTLV infection
Subjects with uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible; controlled HIV is defined as a CD4 count > institutional lower limit of normal and no current co-infection; uncontrolled HIV is all other HIV infection; note that patients with controlled infection should be allowed to participate only if they are not receiving prohibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) interactive medications

History of HIV infection.
Prior history of HIV-positivity (routine HIV testing is not required pre-treatment)
HIV-1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV test or any FDA-Approved HIV-1 Enzyme or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by Western Blot at any time prior to study entry. HIV antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA, or a secondary antibody test by a method other than rapid HIV and E/CIA is acceptable as an alternative test. Alternatively, if a rapid HIV test or any FDA-Approved HIV-1 Enzyme or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (E/CIA) test is not available, two HIV-1 RNA values ? 2000 copies/mL at least 24 hours apart performed by any laboratory that has CLIA certification, or its equivalent, may be used to document infection.
HIV infection
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or a known HIV-related malignancy. Note: HIV testing is not required unless there is any clinical suspicion that the patient might be HIV positive.
Patients who are HIV+ will be excluded
Patients with known HIV.
HIV infection
HIV infection; there is theoretical concern that the degree of immune suppression associated with the treatment may result in progression of HIV infection
DONOR: Infection with HIV
Known HIV infection
HIV infection (due to increased risk of severe infection and unknown interaction of moxetumomab pasudotox with antiretroviral drugs)
Evidence of HIV infection
HIV negative.
Documentation of HIV status; if participant is HIV positive, HIV-1 infection, as documented by any federally approved, licensed HIV rapid test performed in conjunction with screening (or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] test kit, and confirmed by Western blot or other approved test, or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay); alternatively, this documentation may include a record demonstrating that another physician has documented the participant's HIV status based on either: 1) approved diagnostic tests, or 2) the referring physician's written record that HIV infection was documented, with supporting information on the participant's relevant medical history and/or current management of HIV infection\r\n* If the participant is HIV negative, documentation of a negative result for any federally approved, licensed HIV rapid test within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment will suffice; if the initial rapid test is positive, further approved confirmatory test results must be present to document the subject’s HIV status
