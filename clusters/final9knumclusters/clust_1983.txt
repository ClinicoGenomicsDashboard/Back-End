Major cardiac-related diseases, medications, or laboratory abnormalities including the following: a) clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, active myocardial ischemia, or indwelling temporary pacemaker, b) ventricular tachycardia or a supraventricular tachycardia that requires treatment with a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug (eg, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or class III antiarrhythmic drug (eg, sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide); use of other antiarrhythmic drugs is permitted; c) use of medications that have been linked to the occurrence of torsades de pointes, d) second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block unless treated with a permanent pacemaker, e) complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), f) history of long QT Syndrome or a family member with this condition, g) if baseline QTc > 470 ms, average of triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings is necessary; if average value of QTc is > 470 ms, patient is ineligible for the study; h) serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels outside the laboratory's reference range
Serious cardiac illness, defined as follows:\r\n* Clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, active myocardial ischemia, or indwelling temporary pacemaker\r\n* Ventricular tachycardia or a supraventricular tachycardia that requires treatment with a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug (eg, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or class III antiarrhythmic drug (e.g. sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide); use of other antiarrhythmic drugs is permised\r\n* Use of medications that have been linked to the occurrence of torsades de pointes; investigators should note that Zofran (ondansetron) has been linked to corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and the occurrence of torsades de pointes; therefore it should not be used in patients being treated with ganetespib; the use of all other serotonin 5 HT3 antagonists is acceptable (e.g., palonosetron, granisetron, tropisetron)\r\n* Second-or third degree atrioventricular block (AV block) unless treated with a permanent pacemaker\r\n* Complete left bundle branch block (LBBB)\r\n* History of long QT syndrome or a family member with this condition
Known serious cardiac illness or medical conditions, including but not limited to:\r\n* Clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, active myocardial ischemia, or indwelling temporary pacemaker\r\n* Ventricular tachycardia or a supraventricular tachycardia that requires treatment with a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug (eg, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or class III antiarrhythmic drug (eg, sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide); use of other antiarrhythmic drugs is permitted\r\n* Use of medications that have been linked to the occurrence of torsades de pointes\r\n* Second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block unless treated with a permanent pacemaker\r\n* Complete left bundle branch block (LBBB)\r\n* History of long QT Syndrome or a family member with this condition\r\n* Corrected QT (QTc) > 470 ms (average of triplicate electrocardiogram [ECG] recordings); a consistent method of QTc calculation is recommended for each patient’s QTc measurements; QTcF (Fridericia’s formula) is preferred\r\n* Serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels outside the laboratory’s reference range
