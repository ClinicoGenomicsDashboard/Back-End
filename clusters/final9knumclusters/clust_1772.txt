Operable invasive breast cancer
Invasive lobular cancer
Concurrent diagnosis of invasive or microinvasive breast cancer in either breast
Subjects must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer and registration must occur within 12 months after the first histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer\r\n* A core biopsy interpreted as invasive cancer meets this criterion; if no core biopsy is performed, the date of first histologic diagnosis will be the date of first surgical procedure that identifies invasive cancer (biopsy, lumpectomy or mastectomy)\r\n* Neoadjuvant subjects should have no evidence of clinical T4 disease prior to chemotherapy and surgery; eligibility for neoadjuvant patients can be defined by either clinical stage prior to therapy or pathologic stage at surgery; if patient is eligible based on either, they are eligible for the study\r\n* Bilateral breast carcinoma is allowed provided either:\r\n** Diagnoses are synchronous – that is, within 3 months of one another – and at least one of the two breast carcinomas meet the eligibility criteria and neither is Her-2 positive or inflammatory; OR\r\n** The contralateral breast cancer was at least 5 years prior to the current diagnosis\r\n* No evidence of metastatic disease
Patients must not have metastatic breast cancer (stage IV disease); patients with multifocal, multicentric, and synchronous bilateral, and primary inflammatory breast cancers are allowed\r\n* Multifocal disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer < 2 cm from the largest lesion within the same breast quadrant\r\n* Multicentric disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer >= 2 cm from the largest lesion within the same breast quadrant or more than one lesion in different quadrants\r\n* Synchronous bilateral disease is defined as invasive breast cancer with positive lymph nodes (axillary or intramammary) in at least one breast, diagnosed within 30 days of each other; (NOTE: the tumor with the highest recurrence score should be used)
Post neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients must be found to have residual invasive cancer in the breast at the time of definitive surgery; residual cancer is defined as a contiguous focus of residual invasive cancer, in the breast, measuring >= 1 cm in diameter, and with more than minimal cellularity, as per local pathologist determination; please note that in patients that have multifocal or multicentric residual tumors these lesions cannot be added up; the biggest lesion has to measure >= 1 cm in diameter; this is required due to constraints in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction for PAM50 analysis\r\n* NOTE: The presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) without invasion does not qualify as residual invasive disease in the breast\r\n* NOTE: Despite lymph node involvement if residual invasive cancer in the breast is < 1 cm in diameter patients are not eligible for participation
No history of TNBC invasive breast cancer within 5 years of enrollment, no concurrent malignancies of any sort
All patients must be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer
Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III; invasive lobular histology will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation; subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment

Prior history of DCIS or invasive breast cancer
Synchronous bilateral invasive or non-invasive breast cancer
Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer
Known invasive breast cancer of any type
Patients with multifocal, multicentric and synchronous bilateral breast cancers are allowed\r\n* Multifocal disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer < 2 cm from the largest lesion within the same breast quadrant; (NOTE: the Oncotype DX testing must be completed on the largest lesion)\r\n* Multicentric disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer >= 2 cm from the largest lesion within the same breast quadrant or more than one lesion in different quadrants (NOTE: Oncotype DX testing should be completed on all tumors and the determination for eligibility should be made on the highest recurrence score)\r\n* Synchronous bilateral disease is defined as invasive breast cancer with positive lymph nodes (axillary or intramammary) in at least one breast, diagnosed within 30 days of each other; (NOTE: the Oncotype DX testing should be completed on both tumors and the tumor with the highest recurrence score should be used)
Note that patients with (i) non-invasive breast cancer (DCIS) alone, (ii) incidental (microscopic) nodal cancer without a primary tumor (pN1mi), or (iii) metastatic disease are excluded.
