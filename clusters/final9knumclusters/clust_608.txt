Has received at least 2 previous courses of platinum-containing therapy, and has disease that was considered platinum sensitive following the penultimate (next to last) platinum course (more than 6 month period between penultimate platinum regimen and progression of disease)
Has responded to last the platinum regimen, remains in response and is enrolled on study within 8 weeks of completion of the last platinum regimen
Platinum-refractory germ-cell tumors.
platinum-refractory cancer, defined as disease failed to achieve at least a partial response to a platinum-containing regimen (i.e., stable disease or actual disease progression), AND
Platinum resistant/refractory disease, defined as disease progression/relapse within 6 months following the last administered dose of platinum therapy (resistant), or lack of response or disease progression while receiving the most recent platinum based therapy (refractory), respectively
Patients whose ovarian cancer recurs/progresses within 0-6 months following platinum-based chemotherapy have platinum resistant disease; such patients are eligible for this trial
Patients with documented disease recurrence/progression within 6-12 months of completing platinum-based therapy, are considered to have ‘borderline' platinum sensitivity; these patients are eligible for this trial if agreed by the patient and the treating physician
Patients who relapse more than 12 months after completion of platinum-based treatment are considered ‘platinum sensitive’ and will not be eligible for this trial
Subjects must have platinum resistant disease (i.e., which is defined as disease progression in less than 6 months after receiving a minimum of 4 cycles of a platinum containing regimen).
Histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer (measurable or evaluable, nonmeasurable disease) that is platinum-resistant or refractory. In the judgment of the Investigator, a patient who is platinum-sensitive but would not benefit from further platinum treatment is also eligible.
Platinum-treated patient that progressed while on or within less than 8 weeks from the last day of platinum administration
For Stage 2: Participants with non-mucinous, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with documented radiographic progression or relapse according to RECIST within 6 months of receiving platinum-based chemotherapy
Participants who are allergic to platinum agent
Refractory to platinum-based therapy (defined as disease progression within 6 months of last dose of platinum chemotherapy)
For the dose expansion cohort, patients with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer must have platinum resistant disease defined as progression within 6 months after last platinum regimen; platinum refractory disease is allowed
PATIENTS: Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer or recurrent ovarian cancer as described below\r\n* Platinum-resistant disease is defined as:\r\n** Recurrent disease < 6 months from end of platinum-based chemotherapy or\r\n** Progression of disease while on first line platinum-based chemotherapy or\r\n** Initially platinum-sensitive disease that becomes platinum-resistant during treatment\r\n* Recurrent ovarian cancer with any one significant clinical event following completion of chemotherapy:\r\n** Ascites\r\n** Bowel obstruction\r\n** Pleural effusion
Participants in Cohort 1 must have had an objective response to prior platinum-based therapy with subsequent progression ?90 days after the last dose of platinum
Participants in Cohort 2 must have either not had an objective response to prior platinum based therapy or had progression <90 days after the last dose of platinum
Primary platinum refractory
Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer must also meet the following criteria: a. Must be either platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory according to the following definitions:(1)Platinum-resistant: a response to platinum therapy followed by progression within 6 months after completing therapy (2)Platinum-refractory: best response of stable disease or progression during platinum therapy; b. Must have had prior systemic treatment with a taxane; c. Must have received no more than 4 prior systemic cytotoxic regimens
Patient must have suspected platinum-resistant disease (disease progression =< 6 months of platinum therapy)
Platinum-sensitive SCLC after having received up to two prior lines of anticancer therapy, including at least one prior line of a platinum (monotherapy or platinum containing chemotherapy regimen). Patients are eligible only if they had a response (partial or complete) to their most recent platinum and their disease progressed greater than 60 days after completing their most recent platinum. Patients may have received another non-platinum containing regimen, such as topetecan, immunotherapy, or an investigational agent, as their most recent line of therapy, so long as they are deemed platinum sensitive per the above definition.
Disease must have progressed after treatment with a platinum-containing regimen and should be defined as one of the following: i. disease progression or recurrence between 3 to 6 months of prior curatively intended multimodal therapy (which includes platinum therapy) for locoregionally advanced SCCHN. ii. disease progression or recurrence after prior platinum therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting Note: This criterion is only applicable for subjects who have not had treatment in the recurrent/metastatic setting
If the participant has received prior therapy with platinum, the time to the first treatment of study drug from the last platinum exposure is >28 days.
If the participant has received prior therapy with platinum, the time to the first treatment of study drug from the last platinum exposure is >28 days.
Documented platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory disease. Platinum-resistant disease is defined as progression within < 6 months from completion of a minimum of 4 platinum frontline therapy cycles in the pre or postoperative setting (the date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum agent). Platinum-refractory is defined as disease that has recurred/progressed while receiving platinum-based frontline therapy.
