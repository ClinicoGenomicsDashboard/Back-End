All patients must be tested for EGFR mutational status and, for ALK translocation status if no mutation is detected in EGFR. Patients with ALK translocation-positive NSCLC must have had disease progression following treatment with a corresponding inhibitor and no more than one systemic chemotherapy regimen (platinum doublet-based), in any sequence.
For Arm A: must have received 1 prior line of therapy with an EGFR TKI and confirmed T790M negative

More than 30 days of exposure to an investigational or marketed agent that can act by EGFR inhibition, or a known EGFR-related toxicity resulting in dose modifications (EGFR inhibitors including but not limited to gefitinib, erlotinib and cetuximab)
Prior treatment of NSCLC with EGFR TKIs or monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR
Prior or other EGFR inhibiting agents.
Prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy with progression, and documented EGFR T790M mutation on tumor biopsy; however, this need not be only second line
Progressive disease on at least one prior EGFR-TKI (previous treatment with 3rd generation EGFR-TKI including osimertinib [AZD9291] allowed for dose escalation only)
For the dose expansion portion ONLY, patient must: 1) have progression of disease with erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib as last previous systemic treatment, 2) tumors must be EGFR T790M negative confirmed by central testing prior to treatment (If EGFR-T790M status is unknown, patient may consent for trial for biopsy and testing for EGFR T790M will be performed as part of the initial biopsy for the trial: patients who test positive for EGFR T790M by central testing will be ineligible for the dose expansion), 3) be treatment naive for 3rd generation EGFR-TKI (CO-1686 and osimertinib [AZD9291]) and mTOR inhibitors
Known EGFR mutation status
Any prior treatment with erlotinib or other agent whose primary mechanism of action is known to inhibit EGFR
Any prior treatment with erlotinib or other agent whose primary mechanism of action is known to inhibit EGFR
For Phase 1 and Phase 2 Group B, progression after prior 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI (eg, erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib). Previous chemotherapy for NSCLC is allowed.
For Phase 2 Group A, EGFR TKI treatment-naïve and chemotherapy-naïve
Previous EGFR-directed therapy
All subjects providing written informed consent will complete the subject history and screening form prior to MR imaging; the form will be reviewed to determine whether the subject is at risk as defined above and the availability of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within six weeks of anticipated MR imaging; an eGFR result greater than six weeks prior to the MRI imaging date will be repeated and evaluated for renal function; subjects with an eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 will be excluded from the study
Has acquired resistance to EGFR TKI according to the Jackman criteria (PMID: 19949011)
Has experienced clinical benefit from an EGFR TKI, followed by systemic progression of disease [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1] or World Health Organization (WHO)] while on continuous treatment with an EGFR TKI
Demonstrates absence of EGFR T790M mutation if treated with erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib. No EGFR mutation testing is required if treated with osimertinib.
Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agent or other anticancer drug(s) from a previous cancer treatment regimen or clinical study (other than EGFR TKI), within 14 days of the first dose of study treatment
Prior treatment with a VEGF receptor TKI within a time period equivalent to 5 half-lives of the prior TKI (e.g., there should be no substantial amount of TKI remaining in the patient)
Patients should be potential candidates for therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody by clinical criteria
Patients should have clinical characteristics that would suggest an increased probability of benefit from an EGFR inhibitor; specifically, they should have known EGFR mutations or high gene copy number
EGFR genotype must not be known; however, pending EGFR tumor genotyping is allowed\r\n* Participants with positive or pending EGFR mutation on plasma genotyping performed at the central lab are eligible for enrollment, and will not need to repeat initial plasma genotyping on study
Participants must not have had prior treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor, EGFR directed therapy or investigational agent
Patients with EGFR mutations expected to be sensitive to EGFR inhibitors and patients with EML4/ALK translocations are excluded, unless all available Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved targeted therapy options have been utilized; for example, a patient with exon 19 EGFR mutation who has never been treated with an EGFR inhibitor would be excluded; patients with other sensitizing mutations that become actionable with FDA-approved targeted therapies during the course of this trial (e.g., crizotinib for MET deletion 14) will also be expected to have utilized all available FDA-approved targeted therapy options prior to eligibility\r\n* Note: In contrast to the above, a patient with an EGFR mutation who has been treated with a first-generation and third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and then with four cycles of carboplatin plus pemetrexed would be eligible
