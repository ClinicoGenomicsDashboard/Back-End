Patient has known nodal or distant metastatic disease; patients with nodal or metastatic disease require systemic chemotherapy; furthermore, they should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor overall prognosis
Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measurable disease at the primary site or at nodal stations; tonsillectomy or local excision of the primary without removal of nodal disease is permitted, as is excision removing gross nodal disease but with intact primary site; limited neck dissections retrieving =< 4 nodes are permitted and considered as non-therapeutic nodal excisions
