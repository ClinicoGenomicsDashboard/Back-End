Ejection fraction (EF) <55% or the lower limit of normal of the institutional standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated acquisition scan [MUGA]). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or both.
Have a 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram with left ventricular ejection fraction = or > 45% in order to receive epirubicin; subjects with inadequate ejection fraction (EF) or other contraindication can proceed on study without the use of epirubicin

Ejection fraction (EF) by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiogram within institution normal limits; in case of low EF, the subject may remain eligible after a stress echocardiogram is performed if the EF is more than 35% and if the increase in EF with stress is estimated at 10% or more
Ejection fraction (EF) by multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or 2-dimensional (D) echocardiogram within institution normal limits; in case of low EF, the subject may remain eligible after a stress echocardiogram is performed if the EF is more than 35% and if the increase in EF with stress is estimated at 10% or more
