Prior prostate surgery (including transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP])
Prior transurethral resection of the prostate with a large tissue defect (at the discretion of the investigator)
Prior treatment for prostate cancer, including history of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy within 30 days of enrollment or surgery for prostate cancer (except for prior transurethral prostatic resection [TURP] or greenlight photoselective vaporization of the prostate [PVP] which would be allowed)
a debulking transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is not acceptable once the screening biopsy for patient selection has been conducted;
Histologic documentation of prostatic adenocarcinoma; patients with small cell, neuroendocrine, or transitional cell carcinomas are not eligible; all eligible patients must have a known Gleason sum based on biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at the time of registration
