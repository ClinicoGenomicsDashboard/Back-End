relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM): subjects who have received at least 2 prior regimen, were responsive to at least 1 prior regimen (as defined by IMWG criteria) and then are refractory to their most recent therapy (? 25% response or progression during therapy or within 60 days after completion of therapy). Prior therapies for subjects with PRMM or RRMM must include an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) and a proteasome inhibitor as separate lines or a combined line of therapy. If prior therapy includes autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), then induction/ASCT/maintenance therapies will be considered as one line of therapy altogether.
