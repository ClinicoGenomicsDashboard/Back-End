Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal
Prothrombin time (PT) < 1.5 × ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) < 1.3 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) < 1.5 × ULN; unless the patient is on a therapeutic anticoagulant
Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (activated [a]PTT) < 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (within 14 days of study registration)
Patients with abnormal prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or bleeding diathesis
Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN)
The patient has adequate coagulation: prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and an International Normalized Ratio within normal limits.
