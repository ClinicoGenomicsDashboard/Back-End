No previous history of breast cancer (DCIS or invasive cancer) in either breast prior to current DCIS diagnosis
No history of invasive breast cancer in 5 years prior to study registration other than the current diagnosis (prior ductal breast carcinoma in situ [DCIS] at any time is acceptable)
DCIS or Stage I-III primary invasive carcinoma of the breast
Diagnosis of invasive ductal breast carcinoma by core needle biopsy, meeting the following criteria:
High grade and/or invasive and/or carcinoma in situ disease
INCLUSION - ENROLLMENT: Diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma
Prior diagnosis of invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast
Any prior diagnosis of invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer in either breast
Multicentric gross breast carcinoma (either DCIS or invasive cancer) or microscopic breast carcinoma occupying a volume with maximum dimensions of more than 3 centimeters
Women with a biopsy proven diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma of the breast; biopsy tissue (either slides or block) from outside institutions will be reviewed to confirm diagnosis
Women with a biopsy proven diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma of the breast\r\n* Biopsy tissue (either slides or block) from outside institutions will be reviewed to confirm diagnosis
Previously untreated breast cancer determined by a core needle biopsy showing invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma
Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) in more than one quadrant or separated by > 4 centimeters
Multifocal or multicentric invasive breast carcinoma
Subjects with histologically-confirmed operable invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), who undergo core needle biopsy with a plan of surgical excision (goal: approximately 2 weeks of study medications after enrollment)
Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant or two or more breast cancers not resectable through a single lumpectomy incision
Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant or separated by 4 or more centimeters
Current diagnosis of invasive or inflammatory breast carcinoma
Previously untreated breast cancer determined by a core needle biopsy showing invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma
Multicentric invasive or in situ carcinoma
Study participants must be cT1c - cT4a-d any N, M0; any T is allowed if node positive (biopsy proven and HER2 positive) including no primary invasive cancer or only ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS); metastatic workup is not required
Multicentric carcinoma (DCIS or invasive)
No prior surgical excision in the index breast for current DCIS diagnosis of DCIS
Patients with a prior diagnosis of contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are eligible if they underwent a mastectomy or lumpectomy with whole breast radiation; prior partial breast irradiation, including brachytherapy, is not allowed; patients with a prior diagnosis of ipsilateral DCIS or invasive breast cancer who received radiation to that breast are not eligible
Pathologically proven diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer
Histologic diagnosis of palpable invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ
Proven multicentric carcinoma (DCIS or invasive) in more than one quadrant or separated by 4 or more centimeters or diffuse (> 1 quadrant) suspicious calcifications
Patients may have had prior non-invasive (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) cancer if there has been no recurrence; prior ipsilateral invasive cancer also allowed if more than 5 years previous
Diagnosis of pathologically-confirmed invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ
Core biopsy should definitively demonstrate invasive carcinoma
Patients with multiple foci of invasive cancer in the same breast are eligible if any single lesion meets the above size criteria and all sampled lesions are histologically similar (whether radiographically detected lesions separate from the target lesion are sampled for histologic evaluation is left to the discretion of the treating physicians); the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) in either breast will not render a patient ineligible; patients with a small focus of invasive cancer detected the contralateral breast (clinical T1N0) are eligible, however only the histologic response in the breast containing the target lesions will be considered in determining the patientâ€™s pathologic response
Diagnosis of early stage, invasive ductal carcinoma (for which a lumpectomy or mastectomy is planned prior to systemic therapy)
Patient has diagnosis of biopsy-proven primary breast cancer or a diagnosis of pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who will be undergoing intraoperative lymphatic mapping as part of their standard surgical plan
New diagnosis of invasive carcinoma
Personal history and/or concomitant diagnosis of invasive breast cancer or DCIS
Core needle biopsy positive for invasive breast cancer or ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
Previous surgery for DCIS or invasive cancer
Women undergoing preoperative evaluation at the University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) for a new diagnosis of breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or any invasive breast cancer)
Patient must have a tissue diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma
Patient's most recent surgery was wide local excision with or without re-excision and for which there was obtained clear (>= 2 mm) margins at breast conserving surgery, and the pathology reveals pure DCIS; patients with invasive cancer or DCIS with microinvasion will not be registered on step 3, but will be followed for clinical outcomes\r\n* NOTE: if resection is documented to have reached pectoral fascia and deep margin is free but less than 2 mm, the patient is eligible\r\n* NOTE: if no residual DCIS is found on wide local excision as it was fully removed in core biopsy, the patient is eligible\r\n* NOTE: patients with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) as well as DCIS are eligible
Histologic diagnosis of palpable invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ
Histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ
Histologically or cytologically confirmed primary invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or a combination of invasive breast cancer and DCIS. Subjects who had diagnostic surgical biopsies are excluded from participation.
