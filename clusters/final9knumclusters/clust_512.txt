Participants must be at least 2 weeks out from prior chemotherapy, or other cancer-directed therapy (including novel agents), with adequate recovery of toxicity to baseline, or grade =< 1, with the exception of alopecia and hot flashes; washout from hormonal therapy and radiation is not required as long as participants have adequately recovered from any significant toxicities that occurred as a result from these treatments (grade 1 or less); participants may have initiated bisphosphonate/denosumab therapy prior to start of protocol therapy; bisphosphonate/denosumab therapy may continue during protocol treatment; such participants will have bone lesions considered evaluable for progression; washout for trastuzumab or pertuzumab is not necessary
