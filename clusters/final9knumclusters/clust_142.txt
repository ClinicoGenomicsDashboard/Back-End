No symptomatic brain metastasis; (note: patients with treated brain metastasis must be off steroids or on tapering or stable doses of steroids and have completed radiation at least 14 days prior to registration for protocol therapy)
Symptomatic brain metastasis requiring corticosteroids
Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis; however, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for 1 week or on physiologic doses of steroids may be enrolled
Symptomatic brain metastasis
Patients with symptomatic brain involvement
Melanoma patients with large or symptomatic brain metastasis, and in whom neurosurgical removal is indicated will not be eligible for this trial
Symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis
Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis; however, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for at least 3 months may be enrolled
Symptomatic brain metastasis
The subject has untreated, symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis requiring current treatment including steroids and anti-convulsants; neurosurgical resection of brain metastasis or brain biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before the first dose of study treatment
Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastasis
Patients with any metastasis in the brain or meninx that is symptomatic or requires treatment
Patients with uncontrolled symptomatic brain metastases; a scan to confirm absence of brain metastasis is not required
Subject has a history of, or current symptomatic brain metastasis.
The patient has a primary brain tumor(s) or brain metastasis (unless metastasis is treated and stable for > 28 days). In patients who are symptomatic, a brain scan is required to exclude metastasis.
Symptomatic brain metastasis
Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastasis or epidural disease requiring current treatment including steroids and anti-convulsant
Symptomatic brain metastasis
Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis requiring escalating doses of steroids
Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis
Patients who are symptomatic from brain metastasis
Symptomatic brain metastasis. Participants with brain metastases:
Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis requiring escalating doses of steroids
Known active, or symptomatic, brain metastasis
Symptomatic brain metastasis; patients with treated brain metastasis must be completely weaned off of steroid therapy for at least 14 days prior to starting protocol therapy
No clinical neurologic signs or symptoms of brain metastasis (brain imaging only required for symptomatic individuals per 2014 National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] Guidelines)
