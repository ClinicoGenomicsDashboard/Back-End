Any active central nervous system or meningeal involvement
Exhibiting clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma
History or clinical signs of meningeal or active CNS involvement
Clinical signs of or documented leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Features such as headache, nuchal rigidity, and photophobia may indicate meningeal involvement.
Documented history of central nervous system (CNS) involvement or exhibits clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma. If either is suspected, whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar cytology are required
Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement or exhibits clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma
Subjects must not have known central nervous system involvement by disease (parenchymal, meningeal or cerebrospinal fluid)
Active meningeal or central nervous system disease
Participants who have known central nervous system, meningeal, or epidural disease including brain metastases.
Patients with CNS parenchymal or meningeal-based lesions that are present at study entry evaluation are NOT eligible
Presence of diffuse lepto or pachy meningeal carcinomatosis (focal/localized involvement from limited meningeal based metastases acceptable), greater than 1 cm mid-line shift, uncal herniation, or severe hemorrhage/hydrocephalous (small intra-lesional hemorrhage or anticipated surgical cavity is acceptable); patients with seizure at presentation who have been started on levetiracetam and have been stable for 48 hours prior to study registration are eligible at the discretion of treating physician
Central nervous system or meningeal involvement
Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease, defined as brain or meningeal metastases that are not in complete remission
Known meningeal involvement of MM.
Exhibiting clinical signs of or has a known history of meningeal or central nervous system involvement by multiple myeloma
Exhibiting clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma
New or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases
Subject who has central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal involvement by lymphoma.
Participant is exhibiting clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma
Presence of meningeal carcinomatosis
Meningeal carcinomatosis
Patients with known central nervous system, meningeal, or epidural disease.
Clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma
Patient has active or history of central nervous system (CNS) disease or meningeal involvement
Subjects who have new or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases.
Brain metastases, meningeal tumours or other metastases in the central nervous system
Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases, meningeal carcinomatosis, malignant seizures, or a disease that either causes or threatens neurologic compromise (e.g., unstable vertebral metastases).
Presence of confirmed distant metastases, including central nervous system and vertebral or meningeal involvement
History or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS), meningeal, or epidural disease, including brain metastasis.
Active central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma; patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal involvement must be in a documented remission by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation and contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for at least 3 months prior to study entry
Meningeal carcinomatosis.
Distant metastases, including CNS and vertebral or meningeal involvement
Patients with known central nervous system, meningeal, or epidural disease. Patients with stable brain metastases following definitive local treatment are eligible if steroid requirement is <10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent).
Subjects who have new or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases
Known active meningeal infection
Uncontrolled meningeal leukemia
