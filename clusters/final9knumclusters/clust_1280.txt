All subjects must be screened for hepatitis B and C infection; subjects must either have no history of hepatitis B or C, or must meet the following criteria in order to e eligible:\r\n* Hepatitis B: Subjects infected with hepatitis B must receive anti-hepatitis B therapy; per Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, subjects that show no immunity, defined by the lack of hepatitis B surface antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection (i.e. hepatitis B surface antigen positive [HBsAg+], hepatitis B core antibody positive [HB core AB +], hepatitis B surface antibody negative [HBsAB-]) must be on anti-hepatitis B therapy throughout the study in order to be eligible; the exact hepatitis B therapy is at the discretion of the infection disease specialist or investigator; all patients diagnosed with hepatitis B must also meet the liver function test criteria listed above and have no evidence of cirrhosis; however, all patients who present with acute hepatitis B, or who show normal transaminases but are HBsAg+ and immunoglobulin M positive (IgM+) for hepatitis B core antigen, are ineligible\r\n* Hepatitis C: Subjects, who are hepatitis C antibody positive, with or without a positive hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) level, must meet the liver function test criteria listed above and have no evidence of cirrhosis; patients diagnosed with hepatitis C less than 6 months before enrollment will be considered to have acute hepatitis C and will be ineligible unless the hepatitis C viral load is undetectable
Patient has documented evidence of negative tests for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1/2 antibodies within the three months preceding study entry; subjects who do not have such evidence must undergo appropriate testing prior to virus administration; HIV-positive patients are ineligible
Positive blood screen for hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -1, -2 antibody
Known hepatitis B surface antigen and/or positive hepatitis C antibody and presence of hepatitis C RNA.
For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to hepatitis B or C, test results should be indicative of chronic viral hepatitis infection:\r\n* Patients with hepatitis B\r\n** Antibodies: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb) should be elevated and hepatitis B surface antibody (HepBsAb) and hepatitis Be antibody (HepBeAb) low, indicating chronic infection; if the pattern is different from this, please notify the PI\r\n** Viral load: COBAS TaqMan test measuring hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is reduced in chronic phase hepatitis B; the baseline value as the patient enters this study will be useful to discriminate between drug, disease progression, or increased viral load as possible attributions for worsening symptoms\r\n* Patients with hepatitis C\r\n** Antibodies: Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing-specific tests used will be based on the site’s standard procedure for identifying hepatitis C\r\n** Viral load: HCV-RNA should be relatively constant in chronic phase of disease, though the level is typically higher than in the acute phase; the baseline value as the patient enters this study will be useful to discriminate between drug, disease progression, or increased viral load as possible attributions for worsening symptoms
Positive for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibodies
Patient has a positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, or HIV-2 antibody, or has a history of a positive result.
Patient has a positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, HIV-1, or HIV-2 antibody, or has a history of a positive result.
Presence of positive test results for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody
Known hepatic cirrhosis, hepatitis B surface antigen-positive status, or suspected active hepatitis C infection. Note: Participants who have isolated positive hepatitis B core antibody (that is, in the setting of negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody) must have an undetectable hepatitis B viral load.
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive, hepatitis C infection, and/or hepatitis B (except for patients with hepatitis B surface antigen [SAg] or core antibody receiving and responding to antiviral therapy directed at hepatitis B: these patients are allowed)
Hepatitis B or C seropositivity (except for hepatitis B with negative surface antigen and hepatitis B viral load)
Actively infected with or chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus as demonstrated by positive hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen. (Patients who are seropositive only, i.e. surface antibody positive [HbsAb], are permitted)
Seropositive for HIV antibodies (HIV1 and HIV2), Hepatitis C antibody (Hep C Ab) or a Hepatitis B carrier (positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C (active or carriers) are not eligible; this includes all patients with a positive hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis B core antibody; previously vaccinated patients with positive hepatitis B surface antibody are eligible
No history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active or chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) infection; NOTE: a positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb] positive and hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] negative), or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is not an exclusion criterion
Known human immunodeficiency (HIV) seropositive, hepatitis C infection, and/or hepatitis B (except for patients with hepatitis B surface antigen [SAg] or core antibody receiving and responding to antiviral therapy directed at hepatitis B: these patients are allowed).
Positive blood screen for hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV-1, -2 antibody
Documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active or chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I infection\r\n* A positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb] positive and hepatitis C antibody [HBcAb] negative), or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is not an exclusion criterion\r\n* Positive hepatitis C serology is an exclusion criterion
Known positive HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody.
History of infection with the hepatitis B and/or C viruses or positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody
Known positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen (sAg), hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody
Current or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (as detected by positive testing for Hepatitis B surface Antigen [Hbs Ag] or antibody to Hepatitis C virus [anti HCV] respectively); patients must be tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV =< 21 days prior to registration
Active hepatitis B infection as demonstrated by test for hepatitis B surface antigen. Subjects who are hepatitis B surface antigen negative but are hepatitis B core antibody positive must have undetectable hepatitis B DNA and receive prophylaxis against viral reactivation.
Chronic hepatitis B or C infection (e.g. hepatitis B surface antigen [Ag] positive or detectable viral load for hepatitis B or C); patients with prior evidence of hepatitis B or C without active infection are eligible
Has known seropositivity for HIV or hepatitis C antibody, or known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive (testing for these serologic markers is not required for enrollment in this protocol)
Known active hepatitis B or C; patients must have a negative test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis C antibody within 4 weeks prior to starting study drug
Evidence of any active uncontrolled infection (bacterial, viral or fungal) or evidence of natural exposure to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); evidence of hepatitis B exposure includes the presence of hepatitis B surface antigenemia, a positive serological test for hepatitis B core antibody or nucleic acid testing (NAT testing) that is positive for hepatitis B; vaccination to hepatitis B is not an exclusion criteria; testing done in the pre-transplant setting is sufficient to rule out infection
