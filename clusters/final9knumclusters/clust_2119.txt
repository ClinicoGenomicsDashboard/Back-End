Significant mental or emotional problems that would interfere with study participation (as assessed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] Distress Thermometer); any value higher than 7 will trigger further intervention, but ultimately enrollment into the clinical trial will be determined by the enrolling physician
Patients with respiratory distress syndrome
Are unsuitable for endoscopy (either because of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress or unsafe hematological parameters such as refractory anemia < 7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia < 50 K/mcL, or coagulopathy with international normalized ratio [INR] > 2.0)
Respiratory Function: Adequate respiratory function in the opinion of the Investigator with no clinically significant uncontrolled respiratory disease.
Subject has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
Patient is unable to lie flat or has respiratory distress at rest.
Patients with stable respiratory status (no respiratory distress)
RANDOMIZED INTERVENTION: Score of > 4 on the Distress Thermometer (DT) and indication that this distress is related in some way to the caregiving role per self-report
AIM 2: Patients needing immediate medical intervention, for example, conditions such as; hypercalcemia causing lethargy and confusion, acute respiratory distress, dehydration, and/or hypotension
Have reported pain as a concern as well as psychological distress on a National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) screener
A score of >= 4 on the Distress Thermometer (DT) and indication that this distress is related in some way to the caregiving role; potential participants will be asked whether or not their distress is in any way related to their caregiving experience; individuals who answer \no\ will be asked whether or not their distress started or has gotten worse since the patient began treatment or was diagnosed
Respiratory arrest
Meet the screening criteria for psychological distress (National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) distress > 2).
PATIENTS: Previously screened and with greater than 0 level of psychological distress
Positive screen for sexual dysfunction that is causing distress based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) survivorship guidelines
Patients with severe symptom distress as assessed by nursing staff.
PHASE II: A score of >= 4 on the Distress Thermometer (DT) and indication that this distress is related in some way to the patient's breast cancer or survivorship
Have a distress level of >= 3 on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer (DT); this is required for intervention group participants only to be able to show improvement in mood/quality of life (QOL)
Endorse moderate stress or distress as measured by a score of 4 or above on the a distress thermometer and an adapted thermometer of stress;
Score below 4 on a distress thermometer and an adapted thermometer of stress;
Patients who actively decline participation or who are judged to be in distress before the interview
Subjects with any evidence of respiratory infection including any signs or symptoms of either a lower respiratory infection (LRI) or upper respiratory infection (URI)
Participants who exhibit severe psychological distress that prohibits them from participating in our intervention or long-term research program
Patients with respiratory distress syndrome
Right to left shunt, severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure > 90 mmHg), or adult respiratory distress syndrome
PATIENT: Patients with respiratory distress syndrome
Right to left shunt, severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure > 90 mmHg), or adult respiratory distress syndrome
Patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions or respiratory distress syndrome
Patients with respiratory distress syndrome
Patients with respiratory distress syndrome
Severe pulmonary hypertension or uncontrolled systemic hypertension or respiratory distress syndrome
Patients who are considered to be in severe physical or emotional distress based on the assessment by the research staff
Patients who are experiencing severe symptom distress, including severe emotional distress and cognitive dysfunction, which may interfere with study participation; this will be determined by the principle investigator and/or attending physician who is caring for the patient during that visit
recent history of cardiovascular distress (heart attack in past year; arrhythmia; uncontrolled hypertension)
