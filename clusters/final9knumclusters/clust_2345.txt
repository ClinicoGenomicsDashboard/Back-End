Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, UNLESS they are:\r\n* Women whose sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner\r\n* Women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means\r\n* Using a highly effective method of birth control (i.e. one that results in a less than 1% per year failure rate when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, and some intrauterine devices [IUDs]; periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) is not acceptable)
Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active and are not willing to use a highly effective method of birth control during the study period
Males who are sexually active and not willing to use a condom, and have a partner who is capable of becoming pregnant, if neither has had surgery to become sterilized, and/or who are not willing to use double barrier or whose partner is not using a highly effective method of birth control
Men and women of childbearing potential should practice 2 methods of contraception; 1 method must be highly effective and a second method must be either highly effective or less effective; men and women of childbearing potential are defined as: a male that has not been surgically sterilized or a female that has not been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months or that has not been surgically sterilized; patients must use birth control during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug if they are sexually active
Contraception in patients with preserved reproductive capacity; patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or postmenopausal for at least two years; women of childbearing potential who are sexually active and not using a highly effective method of birth control during the trial and for at least three months (in case of monotherapy with BIBF 1120) after the end of active therapy are not allowed to participate in the trial; a highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner
Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration; exceptions: females not of child-bearing potential due to surgical sterilization (at least 6 weeks following tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) confirmed by medical history; or female after menopause\r\n* A “postmenopausal woman” is a woman meeting either of the following criteria:\r\n** Spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 12 months, not induced by a medical condition such as anorexia nervosa and not taking medications during the amenorrhea that induced the amenorrhea (for example, oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotropin releasing hormone, antiestrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs], or chemotherapy)\r\n** Spontaneous amenorrhea for 6 to 12 months and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL \r\n* Females of child-bearing potential and males must agree to use highly effective contraceptive precautions during the trial and up to 12 months following the last dose of study treatment; a highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (that is, < 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner
Patients who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g. such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized partner for participating females) during the trial and for at least three months after end of active therapy (contraception in patients with preserved reproductive capacity, patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or post-menopausal for at least two years)
Sexually active women of childbearing potential must commit to 2 methods of contraception while enrolled on the trial and continue using contraceptives for at least 7 months post study drug administration; sexually active men must commit to 1 method of contraception while enrolled and for 7 months after; hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills, patches, implants or injections are not allowed in patients who are hormone receptor (HR) positive (+)
The following patients will be excluded from this study:\r\n* Pregnant women\r\n* Breastfeeding women\r\n* Men or women who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g., such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized partner for participating females, condoms for participating males) during the trial and for at least 6 months after end of active therapy; a highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly; patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or post-menopausal for at least 2 years
Women of childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control during the trial until one year after the last dose.
Sexually active women of childbearing potential must use effective birth control during the trial and for at least two months following the trial, and sexually active men must be willing to avoid fathering a new child while receiving therapy
Pregnant women or women who are breast feeding or of child bearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control for at least one month prior to enrollment\r\n* Patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgical sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or post-menopausal for at least two years; women of childbearing potential who are sexually active and not using a highly effective method of birth control before the trial for at least one month, during the trial, and for at least three months after the end of active therapy are not allowed to participate in the trial; a highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner
