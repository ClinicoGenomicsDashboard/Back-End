Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.2 x upper limit of normal (ULN); subjects receiving anticoagulation therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
International Normalized Ratio (INR) or PT/aPTT <1.5 x ULN. For subjects receiving anticoagulation therapy, PT/aPTT and INR should not be greater than the recommended range for the intended use of the anticoagulant
Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.2 x ULN; NOTE: subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
Prothrombin time (PT) such that international normalized ratio (INR) is less than or equal to 1.2 x ULN (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to 1.2 x ULN; Note: Subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (tested within 14 days prior to registration) \r\n* Subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =< 1.2 x ULN; subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN); only required for patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; patients are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
INR 0.8 to ULN or ? 3 for subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy
International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.2 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN); patients receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation

Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio =< 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN); subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their international normalized ratio (INR) is within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN); subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 patients receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
Prothrombin time (PT) such that the international normalized ratio (INR) is less than or equal to 1.2 x ULN (institutional upper limit of normal) (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to 1.2 x ULN; subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and PT/PTT therapeutic and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
INR > 1.3 (or > 3 if on anticoagulant therapy)
Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.2 X upper limit of normal (ULN) (evaluated within 28 days of randomization); subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
