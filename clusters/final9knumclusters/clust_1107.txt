Prior systemic therapy for pancreas cancer
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; patients who have not undergone biopsy but have highly suspected adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with borderline resectable features on imaging study may also be eligible for study and undergo the pretreatment biopsy as per protocol; the biopsy must confirm adenocarcinoma of the pancreas to continue on study; biopsy is required within 14 days of starting therapy
