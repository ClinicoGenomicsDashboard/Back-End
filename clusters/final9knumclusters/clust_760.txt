For patients with measurable disease, patient must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Patients must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Target lesions may be located in a previously irradiated field if there is documented (radiographic) disease progression in that site.
Patients must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as ‘non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Patients must have at least one “target” lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Patients must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Patients with recurrence must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v1.1); tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Patients who have measurable disease must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy

Patients must have at least one \target lesion\ to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1 (Section 8.1). Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \non-target\ lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.
Tumors within previous radiated field will be designated “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Patients with measurable disease must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as non-target lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Target lesions may be located in a previously irradiated field if there is documented (radiographic) disease progression in that site
Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \non-target\ lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy
Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \non-target\ lesions unless progression is documented;
Measurable disease (tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \nontarget\ lesions unless progression is documented incontrovertibly either radiographically or pathologically; for clinicians relying on biopsy documentation of recurrence, this must be obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy)
