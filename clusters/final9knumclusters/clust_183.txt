Prior systemic therapy directed at advanced RCC.
No prior systemic therapy for RCC with the following exception:
Prior treatment with systemic therapy for advanced RCC
For subjects with metastatic RCC who have had no prior systemic treatment for RCC and are considered a poor risk according to Motzer criteria, defined by having >= 3 of the following 5 risk factors for short survival: Karnofsky performance score < 80%, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 1.5 X of ULN, hemoglobin < lower limit of normal (LLN), corrected serum calcium > 10 mg/dL (2.5mM), a time from initial diagnosis of RCC to initiation of systemic therapy of < 1 year

Subjects must have a pathologic diagnosis of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with histological or cytological confirmation of RCC and must have failed at least 1 prior line of anti-VEGF therapy (including but not limited to sunitinib, and/or sorafenib, and/or bevacizumab and/or pazopanib, and/or axitinib) and must not have received prior therapy with a TORC1 inhibitor (such as temsirolimus or everolimus); or
Subjects must have a pathologic diagnosis of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and must have progressed on treatment with a TORC1 inhibitor (such as temsirolimus or everolimus).
