Patients and donors must be able to sign consent forms (or if a minor the parent will sign); donors should be willing to donate

DONOR: Related donors must meet all requirements to donate as per Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH) standard of procedure (SOP) for donors
DONOR: Related donors for recipients who have monogenetic mutations must be unaffected; for recipients with de novo mutations, testing of related donors is largely not required, but is recommended in all cases and is required when the donor is the child of the recipient; mutation testing needs to be performed by a CLIA-certified lab, if such testing is available; for donors who carry one mutated allele of a PID which is inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked fashion, the donor must have no discernable symptomatology or penetrance of the mutation suggesting that they are affected carriers; this should be verified through disease-appropriate quantitative and functional assays to assess the function of the potential donor’s immune system (e.g. whole blood EBV DNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], natural-killer group 2, member D [NKG2D] activity, T, B, and natural killer cells [TBNK] panel, and quantitative immunoglobulin levels for a female carrier of the magnesium transporter 1 [MAGT1] mutation that causes X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia [XMEN]); furthermore, the X-chromosome inactivation pattern should be assessed for female carriers of X-linked diseases if they are considered as potential donors to confirm favorable and complete lyonization of hematopoietic cells; for PIDs inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, donors who have one mutated allele for the recipient’s disease will be considered ineligible to donate, regardless of the donor’s phenotype; additional blood tests may be required to assess for quantitative and/or qualitative defects in the donor’s immune system, particularly in cases where PID mutation testing is not available or the PID mutation is not identified\r\n* A NIAID protocol (07-I-0033, Detection and Characterization of Infections and Infection Susceptibility, PI: Steve Holland) is already in place and will handle all the genetic/genomic analysis for recipients and potential donors on this protocol, including the management of results, genetic counseling, and education
