c-KIT mutation status determination, local versus central assessments; at least one must apply:\r\n* Performed locally by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing prior to pre-registration: The melanoma harbors at least one mutation in exon 9, 11, 13, 17 or 18 of the c-KIT gene; NOTE: registration to step 1 may occur upon confirmation of pre-registration Or\r\n* Performed locally by PCR and sequencing prior to pre-registration: if the melanoma harbors at least one mutation in the c-KIT gene but is not in an exon listed or is uncertain whether it is in one of these exons then eligibility to register to step 1 requires approval of a designated central reviewer; submit the cKIT report within 24 hours after pre-registration as indicated Or\r\n* If local assessment is not possible, metastatic (preferred) or primary tumor tissue should be on hand PRIOR to pre-registration and will be submitted to Massachusetts General Hospital â€“ Pathology (MGH) within 5 working days following pre-registration as outlined; if submission of tissue will be submitted more than 5 working days after pre-registration, immediately notify MGH (Massachusetts General Hospital) to discuss the potential submission timeline\r\n* IMPORTANT: if the c-KIT status will be determined by MGH, strict attention is to be paid to the timeframes dictated; specifically, clinical assessments which must fall within 4 weeks of registration to treatment (step 1) may be performed or repeated during pre-registration to fall within the required timeframe
