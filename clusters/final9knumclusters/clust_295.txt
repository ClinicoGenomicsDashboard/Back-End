Urine protein via dipstick =< 2+ or =< 100 mg/dl
Urinary protein =< 1+ on dipstick or routine urinary analysis (UA); if dipstick or routine UA is >= 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate < 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours
Additional inclusion criteria for patients on the arm pembrolizumab plus ramucirumab:\r\n* Urinary protein is < 100 mg/dL on routine urinalysis. If urine routine urinalysis indicates proteinuria >= 100 mg/dL, then a 24-hour urine collection must be performed and must demonstrate urine protein < 2 g to allow the patient to participate in the study.
Urine protein by dipstick <1+ or UPC =< 1.0 by urinalysis
Urinary protein < 2+ by urine dipstick (if dipstick is >= 2+ then a 24-hour urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is < 2 g per 24 hours)
The patient’s urinary protein is =< 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (urine analysis [UA]; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is >= 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate < 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this protocol)
The patient’s urinary protein is =< 1 positive (+) (=< 30-100 mg/dl) on dipstick or routine urinalysis (urinary analysis [UA]; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is >= 2+ (>=100-300 mg/dl), a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate < 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this protocol)
Urine protein < 1+ on dipstick test or routine urinalysis; if the proteinuria on these tests is >= 2+, then a 24-hour urine test must be collected and must demonstrate < 1 g protein in 24 hours to allow participation
Urinary protein < 2+ by urine dipstick (if >= 2+, a 24-hour urine protein must show protein < 2 g per 24 hours)
Proteinuria: if urine dipstick shows 2+ protein, 24 hour urinary protein should be done and be less than =< 2 grams/24 hours
Urinary protein is <2+.
Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio < 0.5 or urine protein =< 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA); if UPC >= 0.5 or urine dipstick or routine analysis is >= 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate < 1,000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study
Patients whose urinary protein is =< 1+ on a dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA); if routine analysis is > 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate < 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this protocol)
Have urinary protein ?1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis.
Urinalysis dipstick for urinary protein performed within 28 days prior to randomization must be 0-1+ protein. If urine dipstick result is greater than or equal to 2+ protein, a 24-hour urine protein must be less than 1.0 g/24 hours.
Participant's urinary protein is ? 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA); if urine protein ? 2+, a 24-hour urine collection must demonstrate < 1000 milligrams (mg) of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study
Urinalysis =< 1+ protein
Urinary protein is <2+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis.
Urinary protein =< 2+ by urine analysis; if urine protein is > 2+ then a 24-hour urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is < 2 g per 24 hours
Urine protein =< 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis; if urine dipstick or routine urinalysis indicates proteinuria >= 2+, then a 24-hour urine must be collected and must demonstrate < 100 mg of protein in 24 hours
Urinary protein =< 100 mg/dL in urinalysis or =< 1+ on dipstick, unless quantitative protein is < 1000 mg in a 24 h urine sample
Quantitative urine protein by dipstick =< 100
Urinary protein < 2+ by urine dipstick; if dipstick is >= 2+ then a 24-hour urine collection can be done and the patient may enter only if urinary protein is < 2 g per 24 hours
Urine dipstick for proteinuria of =< less than 1+; if urine dipstick is > 1+ then a 24 hour urine for protein must demonstrate < 500 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study
Urinary protein =< 30 mg/dL in urinalysis or =< 1+ on dipstick, unless quantitative protein is < 1000 mg in a 24 h urine sample
Has urinary protein is ? 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis; if urine protein ? 2+, a 24-hour urine collection must demonstrate < 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study
