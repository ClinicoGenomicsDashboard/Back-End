Allergy to iodine; this does not include reactions to intravenous contrast materials
Patients with severe allergic reaction to iodine contrast, which cannot be controlled by premedication with antihistamines and steroids (because a hepatic angiogram is needed for the Delcath system procedure).
Unable to follow a low iodine diet or requiring medication with high content in iodide (e.g., amiodarone)
Received iodinated intravenous contrast within =< 2 months of registration; avoidance of iodinated oral contrast is also preferred but not strictly required for study enrollment; NOTE: those who have had iodinated intravenous contrast within this time frame may still be eligible if a urinary iodine analysis reveals that excess iodine has been cleared (defined as urinary iodine documented to be < 300 mcg/day by either a spot urinary iodine or 24-hour urinary iodine measurement)
No prior systemic therapy or iodine I 131 (I131) or chemoembolization treatment after surgery
Prior treatment with therapeutic dose of radioactive iodine (> 50 mCi) with evidence of RAI uptake on delayed scan, with progression within 12 months of RAI
Allergy to iodine\r\n* Note: This does not include reactions to intravenous contrast materials
Dose Escalation cohort only: Allergy to iodine; NOTE: this does not include reactions to intravenous contrast materials
The tumor is considered to be radioactive-iodine refractory by any of the following criteria:\r\n* Total lifetime dose of radioactive iodine > 600 mCi\r\n* Absent or insufficient radioactive iodine uptake in either all lesions or an index lesion which has never been resected or received external beam radiation therapy as documented on a radioactive iodine scan (insufficient uptake must be confirmed by either an endocrinologist or nuclear medicine physician)\r\n* Progression of disease (by imaging or thyroglobulin) within 6 months of radioactive iodine treatment\r\n* Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-avid lesion (standard uptake variable maximum [SUVmax] >= 3) on a FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) scan
No recent treatment for thyroid cancer as defined as:\r\n* No radioactive iodine therapy is allowed if given < 3 months prior to initiation of this protocol therapy; a diagnostic study using < 10 mCi of radioactive iodine (RAI) is not considered radioactive iodine therapy\r\n* No external beam radiation therapy < 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy on this protocol\r\n* No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed < 4 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy
Willingness to maintain a low iodine diet for 12 days (starting 7 days prior to virus injection continuing until after the I131 radioiodine therapy on Day 5)
Goggle assessment substudy: iodine or seafood allergies
Patients unable to follow a low iodine diet or requiring medication with high content in iodide (amiodarone)
Patients who received iodinated intravenous contrast as part of a radiographic procedure within 3 months of study registration; those that have had iodinated intravenous contrast within this time frame may still be eligible if a urinary iodine analysis reveals that the excess iodine has been adequately cleared after the last intravenous contrast administration
Patients in whom iodine contrast is contraindicated
An allergy to iodine
Patients who have been treated with radioactive iodine within 24 weeks prior to study enrollment (radioactive iodine within 24 weeks will be allowed if negative post-treatment scan or progressive disease defined by RECIST 1.1)
Patient must have radioiodine refractory disease as defined by one or more of the following conditions:\r\n* All cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma\r\n* No iodine-uptake on a post-radioactive iodine treatment scan (in presence of low iodine diet and thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] suppression) in an anatomically defined lesion that qualifies as target lesion by RECIST criteria, OR\r\n* If there is demonstrable iodine-uptake: the last radioiodine therapy of (>= 100 mCi) was given within the last 16 months OR if given more than 16 months before enrollment, there is evidence of disease progression after each of the last two radioiodine treatment performed within 16 months of each other (each dose should be >= 100mCi), OR\r\n* If the patient has received the maximum cumulative life time dose of radioactive iodine treatments of at least 600 mCi\r\n* If the patient declines or is intolerant of radioiodine therapy or if with progressive disease that is, in the opinion of the treating physician, likely to benefit from biologic therapy rather than further iodine therapy e.g. patient with heavy burden of disease
Within 18 months of enrollment, patients must have had a radioactive iodine (RAI) scan, showing no or therapeutically insignificant RAI uptake (=< 1%)
