Patient must have received =< 3 prior cytotoxic regimens in the metastatic setting
For both the extension and expansion cohorts, patients must have received or refused first line standard systemic therapy for their metastases (if applicable) and patients (pancreatic and esophageal cancers) must have received no more than two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in the last two years after standard therapy; patients (breast, ovarian and gastrointestinal cancers) must have received no more than three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in the last two years after standard therapy
Patients who have received more than 2 systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic urothelial carcinoma\r\n* Note: prior perioperative chemotherapy is allowed and is not counted as a line of therapy
Participants must have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for management of\n             primary disease but must not have received more than 2 prior systemic cytotoxic\n             regimens.
No more than 5 total previous regimens of systemic therapy, including cytokines and cytotoxic chemotherapy.
More than 3 prior systemic anti-cancer therapies (e.g. cytotoxic agents, biologic agents) regimens for metastatic disease
Patients are allowed to have received up to three prior cytotoxic regimens for treatment of their epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; they must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease, possibly including intra-peritoneal therapy, consolidation, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) agents or extended therapy (maintenance/consolidation) administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment; patients are allowed to have received, but are not required to have received, one to two cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease; (for the purposes of this study poly adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase [PARP] inhibitors given for recurrent or progressive disease will be considered cytotoxic; PARP inhibitors given as maintenance therapy in continuation with management of primary disease will not be considered as a separate cytotoxic regimen); if two cytotoxic regimens had been received for management of recurrent or persistent disease, one of these regimens would have had to contain either a platinum or a taxane agent
Patients who have received more than 2 prior non-docetaxel containing cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).
Up to 2 prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with no prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced or metastatic disease will only be allowed if they relapsed during or within 12 months of (neo-) adjuvant cytotoxic therapy that included a taxane and/or anthracycline, if not contraindicated.
Participants must have received no more than 3 prior chemotherapy or cytotoxic regimens; there is no limit to the number of prior hormonal therapies
