For patients that relapse following a response to prior treatment with bortezomib or carfilzomib, six months must have elapsed since the last dose of treatment

Patients eligible for this trial will be those who have failed carfilzomib either as a single agent as the last form of therapy, or carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone, or carfilzomib in combination with revlimid and dexamethasone; given the potential for compounding/worsening toxicities with the addition of cabozantinib to carfilzomib, patients eligible for the trial will have to have had very good tolerance to carfilzomib in the context of described regimens, with resolved prior toxicity to grade 1 or better, and no toxicities due to carfilzomib that required dose reductions to less than 27 mg/m^2

Criteria 5 Prior therapy with carfilzomib is allowed as long as the patient had at least a PR to most recent therapy with carfilzomib, was not removed due to toxicity, did not relapse within 60 days from discontinuation of carfilzomib, and will have at least a 6-month carfilzomib treatment-free interval from last dose received until first study treatment. (Patients may receive maintenance therapy with drugs that are not proteasome inhibitors or CD38 antibodies during this 6-month carfilzomib treatment free interval)
Subjects must have been treated with at least 2 prior therapies including a proteasome inhibitor and a cereblon-binding agent\r\n* Subjects who are refractory to carfilzomib may enroll throughout the trial; carfilzomib refractory status is defined by IMWG criteria: disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better at some point previously before then progressing in their disease course\r\n* In the twice weekly dosing cohort of the study, enrollment will be limited to patients meeting carfilzomib refractory status\r\n* In the weekly dosing cohort, it will be required that one of the expansion cohorts (20 subjects) enrolls carfilzomib refractory subjects and the other (20 subjects) enrolls carfilzomib/proteasome inhibitor (PI) naive/sensitive subjects
Male patients must agree not to donate semen or sperm while they are taking carfilzomib and 28 days after the last carfilzomib dose.
