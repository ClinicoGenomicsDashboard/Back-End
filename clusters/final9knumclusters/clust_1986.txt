Patients must have at screening a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with mean values that meet the following parameters:\r\n* Fridericia's correction QT (QtcF) interval at screening < 450 msec (using Fridericia’s correction)\r\n* Resting heart rate of 50-90 beats per minute (bpm)
On screening inability to determine the corrected QT using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval on the ECG (i.e.: unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF > 450 msec (using Fridericia’s correction); all as determined by screening ECG (mean of triplicate ECGs)

QT interval with Fridericia's correction [QTcF] >470 milliseconds. The QTcF should be calculated as the arithmetic mean of the QTcF on triplicate ECGs. In the case of potentially correctible causes of QT prolongation (e.g., medications, hypokalemia), the triplicate ECG may be repeated once during screening and that result may be used to determine eligibility.

Meets the following standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) parameters at screening (defined as the mean of the triplicate ECGs):\r\n* Corrected QT using Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) interval at screening < 450 msec for males and < 470 msec for females\r\n* Resting heart rate =< 100 beats per minute (bpm)
Patients with available standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) with the following parameters at screening (defined as the mean of the triplicate ECGs):\r\n* Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) interval at screening < 450 msec\r\n* Resting heart rate 50-90 beats per minute (bpm)
Patient with available standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with the following parameters at screening (defined as the mean of the triplicate ECGs):\r\n* Corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) at screening < 450 msec (using Fridericia’s correction)\r\n* Resting heart rate 50-90 bpm

On screening, inability to determine the Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) interval on the ECG (i.e.: unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF > 450 msec (using Fridericia’s correction); all as determined by screening ECG (mean of triplicate ECGs)
A QTc interval of >470 msec by the Fridericia formula (QTcF), at the Screening ECG. If the subject's QTcF is >470 msec on the initial ECG, a total of 3 ECGs should be obtained at least 3 minutes apart and all within 30 minutes. The average of the 3 QTcF's will be used to determine eligibility. Known or suspected causes of prolonged QTc can be treated (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesimia) and the ECGs may be repeated. If the subject initiates treatment with a drug known to prolong the QTc during the Screening period after the initial Screening ECGs were obtained, the Screening ECGs must be repeated once the new drug has reached steady state to ensure the average QTcF remains ?470 msec. For subject's whose heart rate is <60 bpm, the Bazett correction formula (QTcB) may be used.

The QTcF should be calculated as the arithmetic mean of the QTcF on triplicate ECGs.
