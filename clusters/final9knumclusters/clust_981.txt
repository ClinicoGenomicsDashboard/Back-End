Medically significant cardiac event or unstable cardiovascular function defined as:
Reproductive function:
Cardiac function suitable for protocol-required hydration as determined by the investigator and/or cardiologist
Adequate pulmonary and cardiac function: no clinical evidence of cardiopulmonary disease, which, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes enrollment
Adequate cardiac function defined as no history of clinically significant arrhythmia, or history of myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months prior to study enrollment; cardiac function will be assessed by history and physical examination
