Hematopoietic engraftment as evidenced by recovery of the absolute neutrophil count to greater than 500/mm^3 for > 3 days without filgrastim (G-CSF) support and within 40 days of transplant (i.e. complete blood counts [CBCs] obtained 3 or more days apart while off of G-CSF must demonstrate an absolute neutrophil count > 500/mm^3); if absolute neutropenia is not achieved due to a non-myeloablative transplant, the patient can be enrolled on day +21 to +40
