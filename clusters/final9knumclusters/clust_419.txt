Patients with HbA1c > 8.5% at Screening
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7.0%
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) =< 7 % (Gedatolisib can cause hyperglycemia)
Uncontrolled blood-sugar levels defined as HbA1c > 7%
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) =< 140 mg/dL (7.7 mmol/L) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) =< 6.4% (both criteria have to be met)\r\n* For patients with FPG >= 100 mg/dL and/or HbA1c >= 5.7% (i.e. threshold for pre-diabetes) at screening, recommend lifestyle changes according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, i.e. dietary advice (e.g. small frequent meals, low carbohydrate content, high fiber, balancing carbohydrate intake over the course of the day, three small meals and 2 small snacks rather than one large meal) and exercise; a consultation with a diabetologist is highly recommended
Patients must have a sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and glycosylated hemoglobin measurement (HbA1c) performed within 7 days prior to sub-study registration
HbA1c of ? 8% (all subjects will have HbA1c test at screening)
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >=7.5 percent (%)
Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus defined as glycosylated hemoglobin measurement (HbA1c) > 7%; subjects with a history of transient glucose intolerance due to corticosteroid administration are allowed in this study if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met
HbA1c > 8%.
For all patients (regardless of known diabetes) the following is required at screening: fasting blood glucose =< 135 mg/dL (7.49 mmol/L) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) =< 7.0%
Patients with diabetes or in risk for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials with MK-2206, but the hyperglycemia should be well controlled before the patient enters the trial (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hba1c] < 7.5)
HbA1c ? 8%
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7.0%
Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus defined as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 7%; patients with a history of transient glucose intolerance due to corticosteroid administration may be enrolled in this study if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met
