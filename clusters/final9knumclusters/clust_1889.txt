Angiosarcoma tumor specimen, if available
Tumor tissue samples must be available for submission to the sponsor prior to study treatment.
Patients must have tumor slides available for submission for HER-2 testing; HER-2 testing must be completed by the central lab prior to step 2 randomization
Patients must be given the opportunity to consent to the optional submission of tissue and blood for future research
Paraffin tissue samples obtained by transurethral resection of muscle-invasive bladder tumor, upper tract resection, cystectomy/nephrectomy/ureterectomy, or nephroureterectomy must be available; this specimen submission is mandatory prior to registration as results will be used for stratification
REGISTRATION STEP 1-SPECIMEN SUBMISSION
Patients must be offered participation in specimen banking; with patient consent, pretreatment specimens must be collected and submitted via the SWOG Specimen Tracking System
Patients must not be registered to step 2 until receiving confirmation from the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Statistical Center that the patient's tissue specimen was adequate for PD-L1 testing; patients must be registered within 7 days of receiving the e-mail notification confirming submission was evaluable for PD-L1 status
Submission of tumor tissue is required for all patients; investigators should check with their site pathology department regarding release of biospecimens before approaching patients about participation in the trial
Specimen Submission: Patients must have sufficient tissue available for the required biology study
Patients must have blood and tissue specimens collected prior to registration and submitted for translational medicine; note that patients without adequate diagnostic specimens will not be eligible; with patient consent, residuals from the mandatory submission will be banked for future research
Patients must have adequate tumor tissue to meet the minimum requirement for submission
Enrolling institutions are reminded that submission of pre-treatment serum, tumor tissue and whole blood is required
United States (US) and Canadian sites:\r\n* This review is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility; patients must be willing to submit tissue samples for mandatory central pathology review submission; it should be initiated as soon after surgery as possible
Patients must have had all visible tumor resected completely within 60 days prior to registration; CIS disease is not expected to be completely excised; all patients must have tumor tissue from the histologic diagnosis of recurrence available for central pathology review submission; failure to submit these materials will make the patient ineligible for this study
Patients must be offered participation in specimen submission for future research; with patientâ€™s consent, specimens must be submitted as outlined
Submission of original biopsy for review and verification by hematopathologist at local institution
Patients must have archived tumor tissue from prior tumor biopsy or surgical resections available for submission that is sufficient to complete molecular profiling
Patients must have 10 representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained thyroid tissue slides OR tumor block available for submission to central pathology review; this review is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility
Submission of research blood draw and/or tumor sample
Baseline skin biopsy taken within 6 months available for central review submission
Patients must have a pre-treatment tumor specimen available for correlative studies, either core needle biopsy or equivalent amount or via excisional specimen (cytology specimen not acceptable for this purpose); if an archival specimen is to be used then no interceding anticancer therapy (systemic therapy or radiation to the biopsied lesion) should have been administered since that specimen was obtained; patients with no available archived specimen must be willing to undergo a pre-treatment tumor biopsy
Patients must agree to biospecimen submission for tissue and serum processing and storage for secondary biomarker studies
Participant must have archived tumor tissue available from initial diagnosis or subsequent relapse(s) of Grade IV GBM for submission for central review at Investigational sites local laboratories.
Submission of tumor samples from the diagnostic biopsy and breast surgery is required for all patients
An archived tumor specimen is available for collection
Patient must have adequate tumor specimen available for submission
CT imaging review submission to confirm unilateral pleural involvement; this review for CT imaging is mandatory prior to registration to confirm eligibility; it should be initiated as soon as possible after pre-registration
Submission of tumor tissue is required for all patients; investigators should check with their site pathology department regarding release of biospecimens before approaching patients about participation in the trial
Submission of tumor samples is required for all patients; the local pathology department policy regarding release of tumor samples must be considered in the screening process; patients whose tumor samples are located in a pathology department that by policy will not submit any samples for research purposes should not be approached for participation in the B-52 trial
Patients must be offered participation in specimen submission for translational medicine studies and banking; with patient consent, specimens must be submitted
Specimen Submission Criteria:
SPECIMEN SUBMISSION CRITERIA: Patients must be offered optional participation in banking of specimens for future research

Submission of research blood draw to be stored until after surgical resection of the primary tumor and confirmation of human papilloma virus (HPV) positivity (Mayo Clinic Rochester patients only)
Patients must have paraffin-embedded tumor specimen available for submission for pathological review and determination of 1p/19q deletion status\r\n* NOTE: it is recommended that patients not be pre-registered until the required tumor specimens are on hand and ready for submission; if submission of tissue will be submitted more than 5 working days after pre-registration, immediately notify the Mayo Clinic Cytogenetics Laboratory via email
Patient must have archival tumor specimen available for submission
Submission of original biopsy for review and verification by participating center hematopathologist
