Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 3 x ULN or < 5 x ULN if known liver metastases
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ? 2.5 × ULN unless liver metastases are present, in which case they must be ? 5 × ULN
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ? 2.5 × ULN unless liver metastases are present, in which case they must be ? 5× ULN
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN unless liver metastasis is present then up to 5 X ULN permitted
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN or =< 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 5 X ULN in case of liver metastases
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 3 x ULN (< 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x ULN for patients without liver metastasis, =< 5 times for liver metastases
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 1.5 x ULN; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST =< 3 x ULN is acceptable if there is liver metastasis
Have significant hepatic dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/alanine aminotransferase [ALT] >= 2 x ULN or reported liver disease)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 x ULN OR < 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastases, obtained within 14 days prior to C11-AMT PET scan
Abnormal liver functions consisting of any of the following:\r\n* Serum bilirubin >= 1.5 x ULN (except for patients with documented Gilbert’s disease)\r\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >= 2.5 x ULN, (for patients with known liver metastasis, AST or ALT =< 5 x ULN is allowed)
