A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly
For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [< 1% per year] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 90 days after the last dose of Atezolizumab.
For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [< 1% per year] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 12 months after the last dose of MPDL3280A, and for male patients continued use of contraception must be for a minimum of 3 months post-treatment
For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [< 1% per year] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 90 days after the last dose of atezolizumab
For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [< 1% per year] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 90 days after the last dose of atezolizumab
For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [ 1 percent per year] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 6 months after the last dose of MPDL3280A
Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with partners of childbearing potential should ensure use of a highly effective method of birth control as defined by the investigator, for example, those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly during the study and for a period of 3 months following the last dose of any drug administered during the study.
For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [< 1% per year] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 6 months after the last dose of trial therapy; highly effective contraception is one with a failure rate of < 0.1%; birth control pills on their own do not achieve that rate
