AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and Alkaline phosphatase 2.5 times upper limit of normal (if liver metastases are present, then 5 x ULN is allowed)
Within 30 days prior to enrollment: Alkaline phosphatase equal or less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
Alkaline phosphatase =< 4 times the upper limit of normal (unless clinically considered to be related to liver involvement with leukemia)

Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 times the upper limit of normal
Alkaline phosphatase < 5 times the upper limit of normal
Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 times normal
Serum alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 times the upper limits of normal within 7 days prior to starting treatment in the absence of liver metastasis; in the presence of liver metastasis serum alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 5.0 times the upper limits of normal within 7 days prior to starting treatment
Alkaline phosphatase < 4 times the upper limit of institutional normal
Alkaline phosphatase must be no more than 2.5 times upper limit of normal unless due to disease involvement of the liver

Performed within 14 days prior to study: Alkaline phosphatase < 3 times the upper limits of the institutional normal
Alkaline phosphatase < 3 times upper limit of institutional normal
