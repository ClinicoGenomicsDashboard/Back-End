A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Acceptable methods of contraception are described in Table 4.2.1-1. Sustained abstinence is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception
Periodic abstinence (calendar ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable.

Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their physician; effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine devices); at the discretion of the investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception)
Male subjects must practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following IP discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Note: Periodic abstinence (e.g, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
