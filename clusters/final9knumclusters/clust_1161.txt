The primary tumor must originate in the esophagus; tumors that involve the gastroesophageal (GE) junction must meet Sievert type 1 criteria: “adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus which usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of the oesophagus (i.e. Barrett’s oesophagus) and which may infiltrate the esophagogastric junction from above;” for the purposes of this protocol, this will be interpreted as: greater than 50% of the tumor must be above the GE junction or, alternatively, the tumor must involve the GE junction and arise in the setting of biopsy-documented Barrett’s esophagus (specialized intestinal metaplasia)
