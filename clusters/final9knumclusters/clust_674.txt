Patients with nerve pathology or clinically identified neuropathy
Previous or existing pathology of the external or middle ear which would preclude auditory testing and/or intratympanic dexamethasone delivery
Previous or existing pathology of the central nervous system with potential to impact auditory pathways (i.e. major head trauma, meningitis, encephalitis, brain metastasis, vestibular schwannoma)

Previous diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus, confirmed by pathology
Diagnosis of an abnormal Pap will be confirmed by pathology report
Women diagnosed with DCIS or ADH lesions detected by pathology
Patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN2/3) confirmed by colposcopy, biopsy, and review of the biopsy pathology slides by two pathologists
There is documented concordance* between the initial breast imaging finding and the core biopsy pathology report; the core needle biopsy must contain FEA or IPWA, according to the local pathologist; (it is possible that the central pathology review which is done after the patient is registered on this protocol will have a diagnosis discrepant from that made by the original institution’s pathologist; in that case, the study team will communicate this to the original institution’s site investigator within one week of the date of the central pathology review having been finalized); patients may have a personal history of prior or concurrent fibroadenoma and a prior history of proliferative breast lesions with or without atypia\r\n* Concordance is a determination by the radiologist (or his or her covering provider) performing an image-guided core needle biopsy that the pathology report from this procedure corresponds to the imaging appearance of a given lesion and that the said lesion’s most representative portion has been sampled
Discordance between the initial breast imaging finding and the core biopsy pathology report
Pathology proven diagnosis of colon or colorectal carcinoma.
Patients must have histologically confirmed primary or metastatic cancer; if biopsies were performed at an outside facility, the histology must be reviewed and confirmed by the Department of Pathology at the City of Hope
Patients must have a history of histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer; the outside pathology report is acceptable for study entry; every effort will be made to acquire the outside pathology slides to be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI
Pathologic evidence (either diagnostic pathology slides or pathology report) of a diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II or III glioma prior to treatment with temozolomide or PCV chemotherapy
Location of cancer specified in the pathology report
Pathology reviewed by Moffitt pathologist
Pathology not reviewed by Moffitt pathologist
Exposure risk for KSHV infection (including being a first or second generation immigrant from an endemic area, or male-to-male sexual activity) or evidence of KSHV infection demonstrated by one of:\r\n* Molecular evidence of KSHV in whole blood, confirmed by testing at Focus Laboratories, CA (human herpes virus-8 [HHV-8] quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR], Focus Unit Code 45700)\r\n* Immunohistochemical evidence of KSHV in tissues (for example by staining for latency\r\nassociated nuclear antigen [LANA] or viral [v] IL-6) confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)\r\n* Presence of KS or primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) (KSHV-associated malignancies), confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI
Biopsy proven KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI
Women must have newly diagnosed histologically confirmed ER positive (+) DCIS scheduled to undergo surgical therapy; the pathology report (signed pathology report from attending pathologist) from each individual institution will be used to determine eligibility\r\n* Note: After the patient has completed the study and the slides have been sent to Northwestern University (NU), our pathologists will review the slides to confirm the diagnosis\r\n* Note: DCIS suspicious for micro invasion is eligible on core biopsy
