Diagnosis of anal or small bowel carcinoma.
Previously identified small cell neuroendocrine tumours or pure small cell carcinoma of the prostate, based on a prior biopsy of the prostate.
Pathology consistent with majority of specimen having small cell carcinoma of the prostate (prostate cancer with neuroendocrine features is acceptable)
Pathologic findings consistent with small-cell or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate
Histologic diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma\r\n* Pure small cell carcinoma will be excluded; however, component of neuroendocrine /small cell differentiation will be allowed provided that adenocarcinoma constitutes majority of the tissue specimen
Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with no histological variants (such as small cell, sarcomatoid, pure ductal cancer, transitional cell carcinoma).
Pathologicallyâ€“confirmed small cell carcinoma of any primary site
Diagnosis of germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma or hematologic malignancy
Histologic evidence of neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Patients with histologic evidence of small cell carcinoma of the prostate will not be eligible
Have a pathological diagnosis of prostate carcinoma
Patients with histologic evidence of small cell carcinoma of the prostate will not be eligible
Pathological finding consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Pathological finding consistent with small cell, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate or any other histology different than adenocarcinoma
Diagnosis of anal or small bowel carcinoma.
Patients with neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Pathology consistent with majority of specimen having small cell carcinoma of the prostate (prostate cancer with other neuroendocrine features is acceptable)
History of small-cell or neuroendocrine prostate carcinoma
Pathological finding consistent with small cell, ductal or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate
Transitional cell, small cell, or squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate
Small cell or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate
Pathology consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Pathological finding consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Pathological finding consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Pathologic finding consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Diagnosis of anal or small bowel carcinoma.
Pathological finding consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Have histologically confirmed carcinoma of the prostate that is metastatic or otherwise incurable, and a BMI defined as obese (i.e. > 30 kg/m^2); any histologic variant is acceptable other than small cell carcinoma
Small cell prostate cancer
Patients with tumors that have a component of small cell carcinoma
Pathological finding consistent with small cell carcinoma of the prostate.
Patients with variant histologies (e.g., ductal or small cell carcinoma)
Pure small cell carcinoma of the prostate or any mixed histology cancer of the prostate (eg: neuroendocrine) that contains < 50% adenocarcinoma, as observed on biopsy obtained at the time of diagnosis or on any subsequent biopsies
Prior pathology consistent with small cell carcinoma or prostate cancer with predominantly neuroendocrine differentiation
Patients with histologic evidence of small cell carcinoma of the prostate will not be eligible
Patients with histologic evidence of small cell carcinoma of the prostate will not be eligible
Small cell carcinoma of the prostate
Have a pathological diagnosis of prostate carcinoma
Pure small cell carcinoma of the prostate
History of neuroendocrine variants of prostate cancer, including small cell carcinoma of the prostate
