Patients who have been previously treated with mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus, or with c-MET inhibitors such as cabozantinib
Patients can have had prior treatment for RCC including prior surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy with interleukin (IL)-2 or interferon (but not anti-programmed cell death [PD]1 or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]), target therapy with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, everolimus, and temsirolimus (but not bevacizumab) or chemotherapy
