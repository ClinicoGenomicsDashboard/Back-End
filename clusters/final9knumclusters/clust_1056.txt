Presence of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD)
No evidence of active graft vs. host disease and at least 2 months must have elapsed since transplant
The patient must have no evidence of active graft vs. host disease, and greater than or equal to 12 weeks must have elapsed since transplant or stem cell infusion and enrollment on this study for any other pathology
No evidence of active graft vs. host disease and at least 84 days must have elapsed after transplant or stem cell infusion.
Stem Cell Transplant or Rescue: No evidence of active graft vs. host disease and ? 2 months must have elapsed since transplant.
Patients may have had a prior stem cell transplant (autologous or allogeneic), however they may not have active graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), nor be on any immunosuppression
Stem cell transplant or rescue: >= 2 months must have elapsed since the time of transplant; patients with active graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) are eligible if the disease is well controlled on GVHD medications and they are clinically stable
