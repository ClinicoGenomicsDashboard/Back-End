Received any prior poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) treatment
Patients who are taking or anticipate taking any maintenance therapy while actively being treated on protocol or while being followed on protocol will be excluded; an example of this would be maintenance therapy with a Poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor such as olaparib
TREATMENT: Patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutations must have received specific poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy; if these patients have other mutations of interest, they will be eligible to receive agents based on that mutation
Prior poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy is allowed; patients with ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation should have had prior treatment with olaparib per guidelines for standard of care treatment
Patients who have received prior therapy with a temozolomide-based regimen are eligible; Note: patients who have progressed on a poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and temozolomide regimen are not eligible for Part A of the study
Participants with prior exposure to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.
Prior treatment with a known poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
Patients must have discontinued all biologic therapy at least 14 days prior to registration; prior poly-adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are allowed in the metastatic setting; prior PARP inhibitors in the neo/adjuvant setting are permissible; all toxicities related to prior biologic therapy must have resolved to CTCAE v4.0 grade 1 or lower
Participant has received prior therapy with a Poly-(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.
Previous treatment with carboplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and a Poly-(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.

Patients may not have received prior poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors
Participants may not have had prior use of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors; patients may not have received prior treatment affecting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway in the recurrent setting, including but not limited to thalidomide, bevacizumab, sunitinib, or sorafenib
Patients may have unlimited prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of recurrent locally advanced endometrial carcinoma, recurrent ovarian carcinoma, or metastatic triple negative breast cancer; treatment as frontline therapy for metastatic disease is acceptable; patients who have received prior poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP) inhibitors, MTOR inhibitors, and/or AKT inhibitors are allowed to participate; patients may have progressed on prior PARP inhibitor, MTOR inhibitor, or AKT inhibitor but they may not have discontinued drug for toxicity
Patients who have received prior bevacizumab (or any other vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] targeted agent) or prior poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
Prior treatment of breast cancer with temozolomide, a platinum agent, or a Poly (ADP ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.
