Brain metastases requiring steroids
Has clinically active brain metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms. Subjects with treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment with steroids may be included in the study if they have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy. A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed between the end of whole brain radiotherapy and study enrollment (2 weeks for stereotactic radiotherapy).
Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids in part 1 or 2
Patients with untreated symptomatic brain metastases may be eligible if symptoms do not require urgent surgery or radiation, and no steroids are necessary
Has clinically active brain metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms (participants with treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment with steroids may be included in the study if they have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy)
Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids
Brain metastases unless asymptomatic, stable and not requiring steroids for at least 2 weeks
Symptomatic brain metastases or brain metastases requiring chronic steroids to control symptoms.

Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids.
Presence of symptomatic brain metastases requiring immediate treatment with radiation therapy or steroids.
Presence of symptomatic brain metastases requiring immediate treatment with radiation therapy or steroids.
Presence of symptomatic brain metastases requiring immediate treatment with radiation therapy or steroids.
Participants with symptomatic brain metastases that require chronic steroids are excluded; patients with a history of brain metastases are permitted to enroll as long as they have been treated, off of steroids and have been stable for one month on imaging
Symptomatic brain metastases or brain metastases requiring chronic steroids to control symptoms.
Brain metastases requiring steroids
Patients with known brain metastases requiring steroids.
Participants with symptomatic or progressive brain metastases, or requiring steroids to control symptoms of brain metastases
Known untreated, symptomatic, or progressive brain metastases; presence of carcinomatous meningitis; history of intracranial hemorrhage; or brain metastases requiring chronic steroids
Any known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids. Patients with treated brain metastases must be stable for 4 weeks after completion of that treatment, with image documentation required. Patients must have no clinical symptoms from brain metastases and must be either off steroids or on a stable dose of steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to protocol enrollment. Patients with known leptomeningeal metastases are excluded, even if treated.

A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed between the end of whole brain radiotherapy and study enrollment (2 weeks for stereotactic radiotherapy).
Brain metastases that are:\r\n* Progressive or\r\n* Have required any type of therapy (including radiation, surgery or steroids) to control symptoms from brain metastases within 60 days prior to the first study treatment
Brain metastases with symptoms or requiring treatment
Any known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids. Patients with treated brain metastases must be stable for 4 weeks after completion of that treatment, with image documentation required. Patients must have no clinical symptoms from brain metastases and must be either off steroids or on a stable dose of steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to protocol enrollment.

Subjects with treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment with steroids may be included in the study if they have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy. A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed between the end of whole brain radiotherapy and study enrollment (2 weeks for stereotactic radiotherapy).
Participants must not have symptomatic brain metastases or brain metastases requiring steroids; asymptomatic brain metastases not requiring steroids are acceptable
Brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms, as well as any history of radiation, surgery, or other therapy, including steroids, to control symptoms from brain metastases within 1 month (30 days) of enrollment.
