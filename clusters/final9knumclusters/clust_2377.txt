Amylase and lipase =< 1.5 x ULN without any symptoms of pancreatitis
Patients must have amylase or lipase within =< 1.5 x IULN without symptoms of pancreatitis at registration, within 28 days prior to registration
Amylase/lipase =< 1.5 x institutional ULN (without symptoms of pancreatitis)
Asymptomatic serum amylase =< grade 2 and asymptomatic serum lipase =< grade 2; patients with grade 1 or grade 2 serum amylase or lipase at the beginning of the study must be confirmed to have no signs and/or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g., elevated P-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.), at the screening visit
History of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or lipase that was due to pancreatic disease.
Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or lipase that was due to pancreatic disease
Note: in the absence of clinical symptoms of pancreatitis, elevations of amylase or lipase are not contraindications to therapy on this trial
