Tumor O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status must be available; results of routinely used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction, MSPCR, or quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are acceptable
Tumor O-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status must be available; results of routinely used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction [MSPCR] or quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are acceptable
Part 2 patients must have tumor MGMT methylation status of unmethylated; results of routinely used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. mutagenically separated polymerase chain reaction [MSPCR] or quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are acceptable
Patients must have tumor MGMT methylation status of unmethylated as determined by local pathologist using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-approved diagnostic test; results of routinely-used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. methylation-specific [MS]- polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or quantitative PCR) are acceptable
Tumor MGMT methylation status must be available; results of routinely used methods for MGMT methylation testing (e.g. methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction [MSPCR ] or quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are acceptable
Sufficient tissue available for central pathology review and MGMT methylation status evaluation
Must have known MGMT methylation and IDH1 mutation status to be screened for study entry.
Determination of MGMT promoter status by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) per local institutional guidelines is required to assess eligibility for this Arm.
