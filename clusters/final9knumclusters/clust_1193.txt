Subject is currently receiving or requires anticoagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin at any dose) or any drugs (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.) or herbal supplements that affect platelet function, with the exception of low molecular weight heparin or heparin that are used to maintain the patency of a catheter
Patients receiving treatment with vitamin K, Coumadin or other agents containing warfarin and heparin. Heparin flush to maintain patency of a central venous access device is allowed.
Patients who are on anticoagulation medication that may not be safely held for the procedure (>= 5 days for antiplatelet agents and warfarin; >= 24 hours for low-molecular weight heparin formulations) will be excluded
Patients may not be on anti-coagulants (warfarin, etc.) other than low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
Warfarin and its derivatives are not allowed; patient can be receiving low molecular weight heparin if clinically indicated
Patients on full dose anticoagulants or any dose of warfarin; patients on prophylactic dose of low-molecular weight or unfractionated heparin are allowed.
Concurrent use of systemic low molecular weight heparin or low dose warfarin
Patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin, dabigatran, heparin, or low molecular weight heparins [Lovenox, dalteparin])
For those participants receiving warfarin (Coumadin), unfractionated heparin, or low-molecular weight heparin therapy, the applicable coagulation parameter that is being monitored must be within the accepted therapeutic ranges for those indications\r\n* Note: transfusions and/or growth factor dependent participants are not excluded if the above parameters can be achieved with such support
Concurrent or prior (within 7 days of enrollment) anticoagulation therapy, except for the use of low dose coumarin-type anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis against central venous catheter thrombosis
No use of full dose, therapeutic anti-coagulation with warfarin or related anti-coagulants or unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins.
Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation should be switched to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) before the first cycle of obinutuzumab
Patient is in need of anticoagulation therapy except for low-dose heparin or low-dose coumadin for maintenance of patency of central venous access or prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Low molecular weight heparin or Novel oral anti-coagulant: stable dose within 14 days prior to registration
Thrombologic event within 3 weeks of treatment start date, unless stable on anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or Factor Xa inhibitor for at least 2 weeks
Diagnosis of symptomatic venous thromboembolism requiring therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin or oral anticoagulants) throughout the period of hematopoietic recovery
No therapeutic heparin (including low molecular weight) or Coumadin use
Therapeutic dose anticoagulation with warfarin, low molecular-weight heparin, or similar agents.
Known coagulopathy or taking heparin (including low molecular weight heparin) at full anti-coagulation doses (prophylaxis is allowed) or Coumadin at any dose; patients on aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or other antiplatelet medicines will be allowed to participate
If taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation medication, it must be able to be discontinued prior to the procedure for an appropriate amount of time (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, low molecular weight heparin preparations)
Known coagulopathy or taking heparin (including low molecular weight heparin) at full anti-coagulation doses (prophylaxis is allowed) or Coumadin at any dose; patients on aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or other antiplatelet medicines will be allowed to participate
History of allergic reactions attributed to heparin or low molecular weight heparin
Received any type of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (e.g. low molecular weight heparin or heparin) for > 48 hours during current hospitalization
Chronic anti-coagulation with warfarin; patients on low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux may be enrolled
Current or planned use of anticoagulant drugs such as: warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, Plavix, or Aggrenox throughout the course of the study
History of therapeutic doses of anticoagulants including warfarin and low molecular weight heparin (e.g. for prior deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms) in the preceding year
History of therapeutic doses of anticoagulants including warfarin and low molecular weight heparin (e.g. for prior deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in the preceding year
For patients undergoing a research only biopsy: requirement for anticoagulation with heparin, low molecular weight heparin, clopidogrel, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, warfarin, aggrenox, fondaparux, ticagrelor, etc (aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] are ok but should be held prior to biopsy in accordance with institutional standard of care)
Current treatment with anticoagulation such as warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin.
Anticoagulation: if currently receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, or Coumadin, not eligible
No antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications allowed within 7 days prior to talimogene laherparepvec injection except low-dose heparin needed to maintain venous catheter patency.
