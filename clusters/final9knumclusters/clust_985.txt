Patients who are taking proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within 7 days before receiving the first dose of study drug or who require treatment with PPIs throughout the trial or those who are taking H2 receptor antagonists within 24 hours of the first dose of study drug
Treatment with an H2 blocker, other than famotidine; if the subject requires a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), then esomeprazole, pantoprazole, or rabeprazole may be given
History of continuous daily use of PPI more than 1 year prior to consent
Participants requiring daily or chronic use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and/or having taken a PPI within 7 days before receiving the first dose of study drug.
Treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI); patients on PPI therapy prior to enrollment must stop using the PPI for at least 4 days prior to the first dose of MLN8237
Concomitant administration of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not permitted during the study; patients receiving PPI therapy before enrollment must stop using the PPI for 7 days before their first dose of study drugs
The intermittent use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), H2-antagonists and antacids (including carafate) is only allowed within these guidelines:\r\n* PPI until day (D)-5 prior to the first dose of alisertib and prohibited for the duration of the study,\r\n* H2 antagonists until D-1 and after the dosing of alisertib is done,\r\n* Antacid formulations until 2 hours before dosing and after 2 hours following dosing
Inability to tolerate a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
No concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is allowed; any prior PPI must be discontinued at least one week before receiving MLN0128 (TAK-228)
Regular (>= 2 times per week) use of drugs that alter the pH of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and antacids; exceptions: individuals who use prescription PPIs and have approval from their primary health care provider to replace the PPI with an H2 receptor agonist, i.e. ranitidine, for the duration of the trial will be eligible
Chronic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use or histamine (H2) blocker use that cannot be temporarily discontinued (at least 48 hours)
Proton pump inhibitor use at least once daily for at least twelve months prior to enrolment, and stable dose of PPI for the three months before enrolment
