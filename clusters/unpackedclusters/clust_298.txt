Patients must have measurable disease, which includes lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 2 cm with conventional techniques or as >= 1 cm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scanXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have measurable disease with at least one lesion whose longest diameter can be accurately measured as >= 2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as >= 1.0 cm with spiral computed topography (CT); if spiral CT is used, it must be used for both pre- and post- treatment tumor assessmentsXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients with solid tumors (non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, urothelial transitional cell carcinoma, and breast cancer) must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; patients with the above tumor types whose disease is limited to the skin are eligible at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) and must have a physical exam with documentation of skin lesion(s) by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion(s)Xx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have measurable disease, i.e., lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest dimension in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)Xx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scanXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scanXx_NEWLINE_xXTUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scanXx_NEWLINE_xXTREATMENT: Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral CT scanXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; CT must be performed within 28 days of registrationXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have measurable disease (lesion in previously irradiated field could be considered as measurable if progressive at inclusion) defined as per RECIST v1.1 with at least one lesion that can be measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scanXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have radiographically measurable disease defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 20 mm with conventional techniques or as > 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; lesions in previously irradiated anatomic areas (external beam radiation) cannot be considered target lesions unless there has been documented growth of those lesions after radiotherapyXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients must have measurable disease that has not been previously irradiated, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as >= 20 mm (>= 2 cm) with conventional imaging or >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan; if the patient has been previously irradiated, there must be evidence of progression since the radiation* Please note, this trial includes mandatory tumor biopsies pre-treatment, during cycle 1 and at the time of disease progression of accessible tumor; having accessible tumor for biopsy is not required for eligibility; we expect that at least 80% of patients will have accessible tumor for these biopsies, howeverXx_NEWLINE_xXSubjects must have radiographically or clinically measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that is >= 10 mm in diameter in at least 1 dimension, or an aggregate of lesions that measures >= 10 mm in diameter in at least 1 dimensionXx_NEWLINE_xXAppropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup:* All patients must have computed tomography (CT) scan chest/abdomen/pelvis with multiphasic liver CT scan prior to registration; if CT contrast is contraindicated, CT chest without contrast and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of abdomen is permitted* Participants must have measurable disease at study entry, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 2 cm with conventional techniques or as > 1 cm with spiral CT scan* Patient must have 3 or fewer single or multinodular tumors; for patients with a single lesion, lesion must be 15 cm or less in greatest dimension; for patients with two lesions, no lesion may be greater than 10 cm in greatest dimension; for patients with three lesions, no lesion may be greater than 6 cm in greatest dimension; portal vein involvement or thrombosis combined with a single lesion that is >= 4 cm and =< 15 cm in greatest dimension is allowedXx_NEWLINE_xX
