some examples of what constitutes specific radiation treatment sites defining distinct metastatic disease sites are as follows: a) A lesion in each adrenal gland represents 2 of 3 sites of metastatic disease allowed to be treated on protocol; b) Similarly to NRG study RTOG 0631, disease in 2 contiguous vertebral bodies (with up to 6 cm of paraspinal extension) can represent one site of disease in the spine; non-contiguous lesions in vertebral bodies separated by one vertebral body free of disease should be viewed as 2 sites of treatment;
