Patients must have measurable disease at baseline and 3 or fewer discrete, extracranial metastatic disease sites that are technically amenable to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or resection (at least one disease site must be amenable to radiation); some examples of what constitutes specific radiation treatment sites defining distinct metastatic disease sites are as follows: a) A lesion in each adrenal gland represents 2 of 3 sites of metastatic disease allowed to be treated on protocol; b) Similarly to NRG study RTOG 0631, disease in 2 contiguous vertebral bodies (with up to 6 cm of paraspinal extension) can represent one site of disease in the spine; non-contiguous lesions in vertebral bodies separated by one vertebral body free of disease should be viewed as 2 sites of treatment; and c) Two lesions in such close proximity to one another that treatment with one isocenter is more accurate and safer in the liver, lungs, or other similar anatomic locations should be viewed as one site of metastatic disease treatment.
For de novo stage IV NSCLC patients (patients with metastatic disease at first presentation), primary disease must be treatable with local therapy in the form of SBRT or hypofractionated radiation. If the primary disease is found in the peripheral or central lung parenchyma without nodal disease, for instance, SBRT may be employed at the discretion of the treating institution. If primary disease is more advanced with involvement of the mediastinum (T4 tumor, N1-N3 disease, etc.), these volumes should be technically treatable with hypofractionated radiation; surgery should only be used for metastatic tumors that can be completely resected by lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wide wedge resection.
At least one site of metastatic disease or primary disease must be determined by radiation oncologist to be treatable with radiation.
Metastatic disease invading the esophagus, stomach, intestines, or mesenteric lymph nodes if not a candidate for surgery for these lesions.

Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease
Patients with newly diagnosed, unresectable, metastatic and measurable ASPS will also be eligible if they show clinical evidence of disease progression (including history and increasing physical symptoms); on-study documentation will include a physicianï¿½s rationale that supports evidence of clinical disease progression (i.e., increasing tumor pain)
Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed measurable GIST without platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA) or KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) mutations; GIST may be newly diagnosed or recurrent provided that it meets criteria for progressive or metastatic disease; metastatic disease refers to disease outside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, not simply a multifocal primary tumor; testing performed by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), unless previously conducted by a CLIA/College of American Pathologists (CAP) external laboratory; analysis will include evaluation of 4 exons of KIT (9, 11, 13, 17) and 3 exons of PDGFRA (12, 14, 18)
Patients will be eligible if tumor is metastatic, unresectable, progressive, or if complete tumor resection is not considered to be feasible without substantial risk or morbidity
Known metastatic disease
No evidence of residual involved lymph node disease or metastatic disease at the time of registration based on clinician assessment of imaging; the treating physician will determine if incidental lesions on imaging require workup to exclude metastatic disease; if based on review of images, the treating physician determines the patient to be stage III, then the patient is eligible
