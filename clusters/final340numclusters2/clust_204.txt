Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients are allowed on this study if they have a CD4 count > 400, and are on a stable antiviral regimen; patients with poorly controlled HIV or other chronic active viral infections will be excluded
Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive on highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) will be excluded from the study
Patients with concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be enrolled if compliant with 3 or more drug anti-retroviral regimen and virus load less than 50 copies/ml and CD4 count greater than 250 cells/ml, and no concurrent opportunistic infection or other malignancy
Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive patients must have:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests
Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are eligible only if they have all of the following:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests
Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive patients must have:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test
Patients who have previously tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study (please note: testing of all patients wishing to enroll is NOT required), but HIV-positive patients must have:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests
Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive patients must have:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests
Patients with known active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; patients with chronic HIV with a CD4 > 250, undetectable viral load by PCR, without opportunistic infection, and on a stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) therapy would be eligible
Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are eligible only if they meet all of the following:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL, and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests
Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive patients must have:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests
Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they meet the following eligibility requirements:* They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy from an HIV perspective* They must have a CD4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL* They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, however HIV-positive patients must meet the following criteria:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test
Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive patients must have:* A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)* No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention of opportunistic infections* A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard PCR-based tests
