Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
Patients must be able to take oral medications; patients may not have any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of blinded drug (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection)
Patients with impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of ABT-888 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection) are not eligible to participate in this study
Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that could interfere with absorption
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of oral MLN0128 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection that requires nutritional support)
Patients must be able to take oral medications; patients must not have any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of protocol treatment (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection)
Unable to swallow capsules, or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel, or symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
Unable to swallow capsules, or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function and/or inhibiting small intestine absorption, such as malabsorption syndrome, resection of portions of small bowel larger than 3 feet, or poorly controlled inflammatory bowel disease affecting the small intestine
RECURRENT/ PROGRESSIVE DIPG (STRATUM 1): Patients have impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of panobinostat; for example severe inflammatory bowel disease
NON-PROGRESSED DIPG (STRATUM 2): Patients have impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of panobinostat; for example severe inflammatory bowel disease
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption
Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that may significantly alter the absorption of study agent
Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of AZD9291 (osimertinib)
Patients may not have any impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of talazoparib (BMN 673) (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection, or active peptic ulcer disease); patients must not have active small or large intestine inflammation such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (within 12 months of sub-study registration)
