Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy, chemotherapy with delayed toxicity, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to enrollment
No major surgery within 28 days prior to registration
Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy, chemotherapy with delayed toxicity, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 28 days prior to enrollment and/or daily or weekly chemotherapy without the potential for delayed toxicity within 14 days prior to enrollment
Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy (> 15 days of treatment), chemotherapy with delayed toxicity, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to first dose of study treatment and/or daily or weekly chemotherapy without the potential for delayed toxicity within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment
No history of major surgery =< 14 days prior to registration
No history of major surgery =< 28 days of registration
No major surgery =< 14 days prior to registration
Patients must not have received any major surgery or immunotherapy within 28 days prior to registration
Ibrutinib must be discontinued 7 days before (when possible) until 7 days after major surgery, and 3 days before (when possible) until 3 days after minor surgery; thus, patients to be enrolled on an ibrutinib trial must have completed major surgery > 7 days before initiating treatment, and/or must have completed minor surgery > 3 days before initiating treatment
Patients must not have had major surgery within 28 days prior to registration or be scheduled for surgery during the projected course of protocol treatment; tumor biopsy is allowed
No major surgery within 21 days of registration with stabilization or resolution of surgical adverse events
No major surgery =< 7 days prior to registration and no minor surgery =< 3 days prior to registration (with the exception of intravenous access placement, e.g. Hickman or peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC])
Major surgery within 21 days of starting protocol treatment
Major surgery within 21 days of starting protocol treatment
Major surgery within 30 days prior or during the study period
No major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization
Any major surgery, extensive radiotherapy, chemotherapy with delayed toxicity (e.g. doxorubicin), biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to enrollment and/or daily or weekly chemotherapy (e.g. sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib) without the potential for delayed toxicity within 14 days prior to enrollment
