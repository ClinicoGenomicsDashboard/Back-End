History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis
TREATMENT: Patients with current or a history of interstitial lung disease, known severely impaired lung function (spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusing capability test (DLCO) 50% or less of normal and oxygen [O2] saturation 88% or less at rest on room air) or non-infectious pneumonitis will not be assigned treatment with everolimus or trametinib DMSO; symptoms should have resolved and course of antibiotics been completed for patients with a history of infectious pneumonitis to be eligible
