Estimated creatinine clearance of > 50 ml/min (0.84 mL/s) by the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above ULN as calculated by Cockcroft-Gault
Serum creatinine calculated creatinine clearance by the method of Cockcroft and Gault (< 50mL/min)
Creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Blood creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL (if blood creatinine is > 1.5 mg/dL, calculate creatinine clearance using standard Cockcroft and Gault method or using a 24 hour urine collection for creatinine; creatinine clearance must be > 50 mL/min), within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 50 mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)
Creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance >= 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation or Cockroft-Gault formula) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 50 mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)
Creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dl OR creatinine clearance >= 55 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for patients with creatinine levels above 1.5 mg/dl
Creatinine =< 1.5 x upper normal institutional limits (UNL) OR creatinine clearance >= 40 mL/min based either on Cockcroft-Gault estimate or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hour)
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 X institutional ULN and creatinine clearance >= 60 ml/min* NOTE: creatinine clearance must be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min using the modified Cockcroft-Gault formula
Creatinine < 1 X institutional upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance >= 50 mL/min determined by Cockcroft-Gault formula
Calculated creatinine clearance of > 50 mL/min using Cockcroft Gault equation equation or 24-hour urine sampling
Body surface area (BSA)-normalized creatinine clearance >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (using Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance [CrCl])
Creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 50 mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)
Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Creatinine clearance >= 51 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Serum creatinine =< 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) >= 50 mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)
Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
Measured creatinine clearance (CL) > 40 mL/min OR calculated creatinine clearance (CL) > 40 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault (using actual body weight)
Within less than or equal to 14 days prior to registration: Serum creatinine =< 1.5 X institutional ULN and creatinine clearance >= 60 ml/min* NOTE: Creatinine clearance must be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation
Calculated creatinine clearance >= 45 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equation
Serum creatinine > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation)ï¿½confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is > 1.5 times ULN
Creatinine clearance >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 by Cockcroft-Gault
