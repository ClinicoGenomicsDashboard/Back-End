Subjects taking strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors and/or inducers should be considered with caution; alternative treatments that are less likely to affect MLN0128 (TAK-228) metabolism, if available, should be considered; if a subject requires treatment with 1 or more of the strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors and/or inducers, the study doctor should be consulted
