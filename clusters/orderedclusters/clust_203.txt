Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative
348.0
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are excluded
747.0
No human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; patients with immune dysfunction are at a significantly higher risk of toxicities from intensive immunosuppressive therapies
747.0
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) must have a CD4 count > 350 and be on concurrent antiretrovirals; patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for exposure to the HIV virus; an HIV test is not required for entry on this protocol, but is required if the patient is perceived to be at risk
100.0
Patients must not have any known immune deficiencies; patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study
162.0
Patients must not be known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive
155.0
PROCUREMENT: Patients with active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive at time of procurement (can be pending at the time of blood draw)
44.0
Patients with a known active infection, e.g., hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who are otherwise well and who do not have evidence of significant immune compromise are eligible
107.0
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients who are not on retroviral therapy will not be excluded from cohort 1, the normal liver function cohort* HIV positive patients who are not on retroviral therapy will be excluded from cohorts 2-4
80.0
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients
12.0
Patients that are known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible; note: inclusion of HIV positive patients will be considered at a later date
140.0
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients (HIV testing will not be performed as a part of screening) on combination antiretroviral therapy are eligible for inclusion; the use of zidovudine is not allowed
63.0
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
598.0
Patients must not have known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis B or C infections
28.0
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are excluded
44.0
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus infection are not to be enrolled in the study
57.0
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C are excluded
484.0
Patients known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible
600.0
Individuals who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected are eligible (note: HIV testing is not required for entry into the study)
300.0
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients will be excluded
52.0
Patients with known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) might be enrolled if the viral load by PCR is undetectable with/without active treatment and absolute lymphocyte count >= 350/ul
80.0
Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are ineligible
400.0
Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are excluded
75.0
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals are ineligible
549.0
Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals are ineligible
680.0
History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
46.0
Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
29.0
Patients must not have known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
350.0
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
84.0
No known evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
766.0
Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C infections; testing to prove negative status is not required for enrollment unless it is deemed necessary for usual medical care of the patient
53.0
Patients with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) must have CD4 count >= institutional lower limit of normal within 28 days prior to registration
