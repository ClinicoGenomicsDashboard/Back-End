Total bilirubin =< 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless elevated secondary to lymphomatous involvement of liver or biliary system, or due to other HIV medications (e.g., indinavir, tenofovir, or atazanavir); if secondary to lymphomatous involvement, an initial upper limit of total bilirubin 5 mg/dL (85.5 uM/L) should be utilized - for direct bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL (20.5 uM/L)
90.0
Total bilirubin must be < 1.5 x the upper limit of normal, unless the elevation of bilirubin is thought to be secondary to Gilbert�s syndrome or combined antiretroviral therapy (cART); if, however, the elevated bilirubin is felt to be secondary to antiretroviral therapy, the total bilirubin must be =< 3.5 mg/dL, provided that the direct bilirubin is normal and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 3 x the upper limit of normal; also, if the elevated bilirubin is thought to be secondary to cHL the same criteria for hyperbilirubinemia should be applied; however 1 prior cycle of cyclophosphamide is permitted in attempt to make the participant eligible; patients should not be excluded from study participation unless dosing cannot be safely established
