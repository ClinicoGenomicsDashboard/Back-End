TREATMENT: Pulse oximetry of > 95% on room air in patients who previously received radiation therapy
44.0
No dyspnea at rest
62.0
Adequate pulmonary function defined as:* No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, no chronic oxygen requirement, and room air pulse oximetry > 94% if there is a clinical indication for pulse oximetry; normal pulmonary function tests in patients who are capable of cooperating with testing (including diffusion capacity of the lung of carbon monoxide [DLCO]) are required if there is a clinical indication for determination; for patients who do not have respiratory symptoms, full pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are NOT required
74.0
Patients must have no evidence of dyspnea at rest and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air
189.0
RANDOMIZED PHASE II (ARMS K AND L): Patients must have no evidence of dyspnea at rest and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air
189.0
Patients with a history of pulmonary dysfunction must have no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance due to pulmonary insufficiency, and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air unless current dysfunction is due to the lymphoma in which case the patient is eligible
140.0
Oxygen saturation on room air > 92 % by pulse oximetry; (patients on intermittent or continuous supplemental oxygen are not allowed)
92.0
Uncontrolled asthma or oxygen (O2) saturation < 90% by ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis or pulse oximetry on room air
23.0
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance due to pulmonary insufficiency, and a pulse oximetry > 92% while breathing room air
484.0
For children who are unable to cooperate for PFTs, the criteria are: no evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a pulse oximetry reading of > 92% on room air
600.0
No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and a resting pulse oximetry reading > 94% on room air if there is clinical indication for determination
