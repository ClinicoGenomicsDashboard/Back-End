Patients must have a cardiac ejection fraction of >= 40%, or within institutional normal limits; a nuclear medicine gated blood pool examination is preferred; a 2-D ECHO scan is acceptable if a calculated ejection fraction is obtained and follow-up measurement of the cardiac ejection fraction will also be performed by echocardiography; measurement of cardiac ejection fraction should be within two weeks prior to allogeneic transplantation
