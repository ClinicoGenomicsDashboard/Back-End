Patient may be receiving or have completed induction therapy within 60 days prior to preregistration to step 0; no more than 300 days may have passed between the first day of induction therapy and preregistration to step 0* For patients who have completed induction therapy, restaging evaluation must show status of partial (PR) or complete response (CR); post-induction patients with evidence of clinical disease progression are not eligible for preregistration* Up to two regimens of chemotherapy are allowed as long as a continuous response was ongoing throughout therapy; overall, a partial response needs to have been achieved (using studies at the time of diagnosis as the baseline)**NOTE: For example, a patient who started treatment with rituximab/bendamustine and was then switched to rituximab(R)-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone (CHOP) (due to insufficient response or excessive toxicity) would be counted as having received 2 regimens; however, R-CHOP alternating with R-dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) as a planned induction regimen would count as one regimen

It is preferred that axillary lymph node sampling is performed after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to allow more accurate assessment of pathologic response; patients must have a complete axillary lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the following situations (exceptions will be granted for patients participating in the Alliance A11202 trial):* Patients had documented pathologic involvement of the axillary nodes (fine needle aspiration [FNA] or core biopsy) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with positive sentinel node(s)* Patient had documented pathologic involvement of the axillary nodes (FNA or core biopsy) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had only 1 sentinel lymph node removed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy** NOTE: Patients who undergo sentinel node biopsy before starting neoadjuvant treatment and do not undergo post neoadjuvant assessment of the axillary nodes or who have negative axillary nodes on post neoadjuvant assessment must have >= 1 cm residual invasive cancer in the breast after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
