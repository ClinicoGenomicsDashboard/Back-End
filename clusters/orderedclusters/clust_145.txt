Patients with known history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) are not eligible:* History of RVO, or predisposing factors to RVO (e.g. uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled systemic disease such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes)* Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic exam that is considered a risk factor for RVO such as:** Evidence of new optic disc cupping** Evidence of new visual field defects** Intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg** NOTE: Ophthalmic exam is required for all patients; exam must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration
