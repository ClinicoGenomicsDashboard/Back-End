STEP I: Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease as defined by having one or more of the following, obtained within 28 days prior to randomization:* >= 1 g/dL monoclonal protein (M-protein) on serum protein electrophoresis* >= 200 mg/24 hours (hrs) of monoclonal protein on a 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis* Involved free light chain >= 10 mg/dL or >= 100 mg/L AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain ratio (< 0.26 or > 1.65)* Monoclonal bone marrow plasmacytosis >= 30% (evaluable disease)* Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and serum free light chain (FLC) assay are required to be performed within 28 days prior to randomization; a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate is required within 28 days if bone marrow is being followed for response** NOTE: UPEP (on a 24-hour collection) is required, no substitute method is acceptable; urine must be followed monthly if the baseline urine M-spike is >= 200 mg/24 hr; please note that if both serum and urine M-components are present, both must be followed in order to evaluate response** NOTE: The serum free light chain test is required to be done if the patient does not have measurable disease in the serum or urine; measurable disease in the serum is defined as having a serum M-spike >= 1 g/dL; measurable disease in the urine is defined as having a urine M-spike >= 200 mg/24 hr
1080.0
Greater than 2+ proteinuria on two consecutive dipsticks taken no less than 1 week apart or 24-hour urine protein of > 1 g; patients with < 2+ proteinuria are eligible following initial determination by urinalysis within 1 week prior to enrollment and do not need the urinalysis repeated
70.0
Patients must have measurable disease defined as any of the following:* Serum monoclonal protein >= 500 mg/dL by protein electrophoresis * > 200 mg of monoclonal protein in the urine on screening 24-hour electrophoresis * Serum immunoglobulin free light chain >= 100 mg/L AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain ratio
28.0
Urine protein should be screened by dipstick or urine analysis; for proteinuria > 1+ or urine protein: creatinine ratio > 1.0, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be < 2000 mg for patient enrollment
57.0
Urine protein should be screened by urinalysis; if protein is 2+ or higher, 24 hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be < 1000 mg for patient enrollment
23.0
Urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) =< 1 on spot urinalysis or protein =< 500 mg/24 hour urine
36.0
Proteinuria as defined as >= 2+ on urine dipstick; if dipstick urinalysis shows >= 2+ proteinuria, 24-hour urine for protein must be < 2 grams
42.0
Urine protein: =< 30 mg/dl in urinalysis or =< 1+ on dipstick, unless quantitative protein is < 1000 mg in a 24 hour (h) urine sample
67.0
Baseline urinalysis should show urine protein < 3+ and must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration; if urine protein is 3+ or greater, then urine protein by 24 hour collection must show less than 3 grams of protein
180.0
Urine protein: =< 30 mg/dl in urinalysis or =< 1+ on dipstick, unless quantitative protein is < 1000 mg in a 24 hour (h) urine sample

Urine protein must be screened by urinalysis; if protein is 2+ or higher, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be < 1000 mg for patient enrollment
22.0
Urine protein should be screened by urine analysis; if protein is 2+ or higher, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained; patients with 24-hour urine protein >= 1000 mg are excluded
