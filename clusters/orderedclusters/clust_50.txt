Patients with abnormal liver function will be eligible and will be grouped according to the criteria below* Group A (normal hepatic function)** Bilirubin =< upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< ULN* Group B (mild hepatic dysfunction)** B1: bilirubin =< ULN and AST > ULN** B2: bilirubin > ULN but =< 1.5 x ULN and any AST* Group C (moderate hepatic dysfunction)** Bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN to =< 3 x ULN and any AST* Group D (severe hepatic dysfunction) ** Bilirubin > 3 x ULN and up to investigators discretion and any AST* Patients with active hemolysis should be excluded; no distinction will be made between liver dysfunction due to metastases and liver dysfunction due to other causes; registration laboratory investigations will be used to assign a patient to a hepatic function group; liver function tests should be repeated within 24 hours prior to starting initial therapy and may result in the patients' group assignment being altered if different to registration test results
