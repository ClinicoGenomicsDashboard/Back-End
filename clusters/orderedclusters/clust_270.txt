For patients enrolled in arm A dose level 4, arm A 14-patients expansion cohort, and arm B (first stage of phase II of TRC102 and pemetrexed) measurable disease is required according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for patients with solid tumors and modified RECIST criteria as described by Byrne and Novak for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma; pleural effusion and ascites are not considered measurable disease
58.0
Disease may be measurable (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria) or non-measurable but must be present in at least one non-liver site, where presence is defined as 1.5 cm or greater and visualized on PET/CT with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG); patients with effusion only disease or disease only in the liver are not eligible for the study
99.0
Patients must have evaluable disease � defined as one of the following:* Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 measurable disease OR* Evaluable disease (defined as solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definitions for target lesions OR ascites and/or pleural effusion that has been pathologically demonstrated to be disease-related) AND a cancer antigen 125 (CA125) that has doubled from the post-treatment nadir and is also greater than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
549.0
Phase III study: evaluable disease - defined as RECIST 1.1 measurable disease OR non-measurable disease (defined as solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definitions for target lesions OR ascites and/or pleural effusion that has been pathologically demonstrated to be disease-related in the setting of a cancer antigen [CA]125 >= 2 x upper limit of normal [ULN])

680.0
Patients must have measurable or evaluable/non-measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; patients with bone only disease are not eligible; NOTE: for patients with metastatic disease in the liver, tumor burden should not be deemed significant (e.g., to no more than 30% of total liver volume as assessed by local review/investigator)
