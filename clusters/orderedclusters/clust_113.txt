Patients must have prothrombin time (PT) / international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 2.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless the patient is on anticoagulant therapy within 28 days prior to registration (if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, PT, and a PTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)

Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x institutional ULN, unless the subject is on anticoagulant therapy; (if the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, PT, and activated PTT (aPTT) must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)

Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =< 1.5 x institutional unless the subject is on anticoagulant therapy (if the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, PT, and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] must be within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)
