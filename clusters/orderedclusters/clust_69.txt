Patients must have radiographically measurable disease; measurable disease is defined as the presence of at least one lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan that can be accurately measured with the longest diameter a minimum of 10 mm in at least one dimension (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)* Note: The following do NOT qualify as measurable disease: ** Malignant fluid collections (e.g., ascites, pleural effusions)** Bone marrow infiltration** Lesions only detected by nuclear medicine studies (e.g., bone, gallium or positron emission tomography [PET] scans) ** Elevated tumor markers in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** Previously radiated lesions that have not demonstrated clear progression post radiation ** Leptomeningeal lesions that do not meet the measurement parameters noted above
