For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to hepatitis B or C, test results should be indicative of chronic viral hepatitis infection:* Patients with hepatitis B** Antibodies: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb) should be elevated and hepatitis B surface antibody (HepBsAb) and hepatitis Be antibody (HepBeAb) low, indicating chronic infection; if the pattern is different from this, please notify the PI** Viral load: COBAS TaqMan test measuring hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is reduced in chronic phase hepatitis B; the baseline value as the patient enters this study will be useful to discriminate between drug, disease progression, or increased viral load as possible attributions for worsening symptoms* Patients with hepatitis C** Antibodies: Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing-specific tests used will be based on the siteï¿½s standard procedure for identifying hepatitis C** Viral load: HCV-RNA should be relatively constant in chronic phase of disease, though the level is typically higher than in the acute phase; the baseline value as the patient enters this study will be useful to discriminate between drug, disease progression, or increased viral load as possible attributions for worsening symptoms
