Patients with brain metastases who require corticosteroids or non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants must be on a stable dose of corticosteroids and seizure free for 1 month prior to enrollment; patients with known brain metastases should have completed brain irradiation (whole brain or gamma knife) more than 4 weeks before starting the protocol; patients on enzyme inducing anticonvulsants are not eligible; note that patients should have had their steroids tapered to low dose (i.e. < 1.5 mg of dexamethasone/day) due to the potential for higher dexamethasone doses to induce CYP3A4
