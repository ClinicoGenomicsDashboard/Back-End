Systolic cardiac function will be assessed at screening if clinically indicated by history and physical; only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% will be eligible for enrollment
28.0
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% (measured within 28 days of study entry)
96.0
Patients must have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 45% or within institutional normal limits
57.0
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, regardless of whether there are symptoms of heart failure
50.0
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50%

If cardiac function assessment is clinically indicated or performed: participants will be ineligible if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is less than normal per institutional guidelines, or < 55%, if the threshold for normal is not otherwise specified by institutional guidelines
