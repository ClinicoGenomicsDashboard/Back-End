there was no influence on the relapse incidence; the effects of donor CMV status remained in multivariate analyses; the effect of donor status was different among different disease categories; in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, T-cell depletion abrogated the beneficial effect of donor status, suggesting that the effect is mediated through transfer of donor immunity;

for donors who carry one mutated allele of a PID which is inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked fashion, the donor must have no discernable symptomatology or penetrance of the mutation suggesting that they are affected carriers;

furthermore, the X-chromosome inactivation pattern should be assessed for female carriers of X-linked diseases if they are considered as potential donors to confirm favorable and complete lyonization of hematopoietic cells; for PIDs inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, donors who have one mutated allele for the recipient’s disease will be considered ineligible to donate, regardless of the donor’s phenotype; additional blood tests may be required to assess for quantitative and/or qualitative defects in the donor’s immune system, particularly in cases where PID mutation testing is not available or the PID mutation is not identified\r\n* A NIAID protocol (07-I-0033, Detection and Characterization of Infections and Infection Susceptibility, PI: Steve Holland) is already in place and will handle all the genetic/genomic analysis for recipients and potential donors on this protocol, including the management of results, genetic counseling, and educationXx_NEWLINE_xXDONOR: Related donors undergoing bone marrow harvest should be deemed fit for the operative procedure and related donors undergoing apheresis should be deemed fit for the collection procedureXx_NEWLINE_xXDONOR: Related donors will undergo the donor health history screen by skilled staff in the Blood Services Section for adult donors and age-appropriate questioning when indicated for pediatric donors to determine donor eligibility using standard Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) criteriaXx_NEWLINE_xXDONOR: Unrelated donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) Standard Policies and Procedures except for the additional requirement of EBV serostatus testing;

in these cases, the HSCT donor, if EBV-seropositive, will be used as the donor of EBV-specific T-cells for adoptive immunotherapy wherever possible, because the EBV-LPD are almost invariably derived from that marrow donor; these patients will be enrolled onto protocol Institutional Review Board (IRB) # 95-024; however, if the HSCT donor is EBV seronegative or not readily available (e.g. a cord blood transplant), the patient will be a candidate to receive EBV-specific T-cells generated from a third party seropositive donor that have been generated and stored in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) bank of cryopreserved immune T-cells for adoptive cell therapy; for these patients, the third party donor derived T cells to be used will be selected primarily on the basis of 1) matching for, at least, 2 HLA antigens and 2) one restricted allele shared by the transplant donor and recipient; however, priority is given to T cells partially HLA antigen matched with, and restricted by, HLA alleles of the transplant donor, since EBV + lymphomas in HSCT recipients are usually (but not always) derived from the transplant donors' cellsXx_NEWLINE_xXPatients developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic organ transplant;

if the origin of the lymphoma is unknown, T-cells partially matched with the recipient transplant will be used, since these lymphomas are usually of host origin; using this approach to donor selection, it is expected that the EBV-specific, HLA restricted cytotoxic T-cells expanded from the HLA partially-matched donor would be able to recognize and kill lymphoma cells presenting EBV antigens in the context of an appropriate HLA restricting element;
