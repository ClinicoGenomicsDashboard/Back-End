skip lesions in the same bone as the primary tumor do not constitute metastatic disease; skip lesions in an adjacent bone are considered bone metastases; if there is any doubt whether lesions are metastatic, a biopsy of those lesions should be performed\r\n* Contralateral pleural effusion and/or contralateral pleural nodules\r\n* Distant lymph node involvement\r\n* Patients with pulmonary nodules are considered to have metastatic disease if the patient has:\r\n** Solitary nodule >= 0.5 cm or multiple nodules of >= 0.3 cm unless lesion is biopsied and negative for tumor\r\n** Patients with solitary nodule < 0.5 cm or multiple nodules < 0.3 cm are not considered to have lung metastasis unless biopsy documents tumor\r\n* Bone marrow metastatic disease is based on morphologic evidence of Ewing sarcoma based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains; in the absence of morphologic evidence of marrow involvement on H&E, patients with bone marrow involvement detected ONLY by flow cytometry, reverse-transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or immunohistochemistry will NOT be considered to have clinical bone marrow involvement for the purposes of this study\r\n** This study requires bilateral bone marrow biopsies at study entry; the suggested approach for patients with large pelvic tumors in which a posterior iliac crest bone marrow biopsy would track through the tumor is to instead undergo 2 marrow biopsies on the contralateral side (either 2 posterior biopsies or one posterior and one anterior biopsy)\r\n* Bone metastasis: This study utilizes whole body FDG-PET scans to screen patients for bone metastases; areas suspicious for bone metastasis based on FDG-PET scans require confirmatory anatomic imaging with either MRI or computed tomography (CT) (whole body FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/magnetic resonance [MR] scan acceptable); whole body technetium bone scans may be performed at the discretion of the investigator and are not required; for patients without other sites of metastatic disease whose sole metastatic site to qualify for study entry is a single area suspicious for bone metastasis identified by FDG-PET, confirmatory biopsy or anatomic imaging evidence of an associated soft tissue mass at that site is required for study entryXx_NEWLINE_xXFirst relapse of B-ALL, allowable sites of disease include isolated bone marrow, combined bone marrow and CNS and/or testicular, and isolated CNS and/or testicular;

in cases where it is clinically prohibitive, peripheral blood with an excess of 20% blasts and in which adequate flow cytometric and cytogenetics/FISH testing is feasible can be substituted for the marrow exam at diagnosis\r\n* Patients has cytopenias and/or bone marrow blasts but does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of AML (WHO Myeloid Neoplasm classification) because of < 20% marrow blasts and meets the criteria for a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\r\n* Patients has a history of transient myeloproliferative disorder (which may or may not have required chemotherapy intervention), who:\r\n* Are > 8 weeks since resolution of transient myeloproliferative disease (TMD) with >= 5% blasts, OR\r\n* Patients who have an increasing blast count (>= 5%) in serial bone marrow aspirates performed at least 4 weeks apartXx_NEWLINE_xXMetastases with indistinct borders making targeting not feasible\r\n* NOTE: A potential issue with bone metastases is that they often are not discrete; since many patients on this protocol will have bone metastases, this will be an important issue; theoretically, Houndsfield units might provide an appropriate measure; however, a sclerotic lesion against dense cortical bone will not have a sharp demarcation based on Houndsfield units (HU); therefore, we acknowledge that such determinations will pose a challenge and thus the physician’s judgment will be requiredXx_NEWLINE_xXAll newly diagnosed patients must have evidence of ALL in their marrow or peripheral blood with at least 20% lymphoblasts present in blood or bone marrow collected within 28 days prior to registration; all relapsed/refractory patients (Cohort 2) must have at least 5% lymphoblasts present in blood or bone marrow collected within 28 days prior to registration; for relapsed/refractory patients, pathology and cytogenetics reports (both from time of original diagnosis) must be submitted at time of registration; if a bone marrow aspirate cannot be obtained despite an attempt (dry tap), appropriate immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, including CD19, must be performed on the bone marrow biopsy to determine lineage; for ALL in marrow or peripheral blood, immunophenotyping of the blood or marrow lymphoblasts must be performed to determine lineage (B cell, T cell or mixed B/T cell); appropriate marker studies including cluster of differentiation (CD)19 (B cell), must be performed; co-expression of myeloid antigens (CD13 and CD33) will not exclude patients; if possible, the lineage specific markers (myeloid cells) should be determined; the blood/bone marrow sample for these assays must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration; patients with only extramedullary disease in the absence of bone marrow or blood involvement are not eligibleXx_NEWLINE_xXIn the event that the patient’s bone marrow blast count is >= 50% blasts, patients may be registered but should receive steroids for 3-5 days in order to reduce tumor burden prior to blinatumomab administration, as follows\r\n* Prephase treatment with dexamethasone (10-20 mg/m^2) for 3-5 days is required for patients with bone marrow blasts >= 50%, peripheral blood blasts 15,000/uL or higher, or elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) suggesting rapidly progressive disease per investigator opinion\r\n** Pre-treatment should conclude at least 24 hours prior to the first dose of blinatumomab (although additional dexamethasone is automatically given as a pre-med prior to the first dose);
