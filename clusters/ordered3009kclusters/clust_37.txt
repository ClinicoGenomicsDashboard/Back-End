Operable and necessitates adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment
Completed NCCN approved neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy or both
Patient is not now, and never has received adjuvant endocrine therapy OR patient is currently receiving or has received adjuvant endocrine therapy in the past, AND adjuvant endocrine therapy was initiated > 2 years prior to diagnosis of metastatic disease\r\n* Note: patients who developed metastatic disease while still receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy must have a planned change in the type of endocrine agent used for subsequent metastatic disease treatment; patient is not receiving blocking adjuvant therapy (such as toremifene or tamoxifen) OR patient is receiving blocking adjuvant therapy, but will stop this therapy a minimum of 60 days prior to FES-PET/CT while still complying with the study timeline
No prior history of androgen deprivation therapy within the last month; however patients who will receive neoadjuvant and concurrent and adjuvant hormonal therapy will be eligible
Has a plan for cystoscopic surveillance (adjuvant intravesical therapy allowed)
No prior endocrine therapy for metastatic disease is allowed (i.e. must be first-line endocrine therapy for metastatic disease). However, a history of adjuvant endocrine therapy is allowed, as long as the date of diagnosis of metastatic disease is > 2 years following initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patients who develop metastatic disease while still receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy must have a change in the type of endocrine agent used for subsequent metastatic disease treatment. Patients on blocking adjuvant therapy (with a blocking agent such as toremifene or tamoxifen) must be off the agents for a minimum of 60 days to allow for adequate uptake of FES.
Received any radiation or hormone therapy (neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, or salvage)
The patient must have completed adjuvant chemotherapy more than 6 months ago, but no more than 36 months prior to initial study scan
Neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy
Subjects who have received prior adjuvant therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma are eligible if neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy (including chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) was fully completed more than 4 months before the start of study treatment. In this case, prior Gem and/or NP is allowable
No prior treatment with carboplatin in the metastatic setting; carboplatin in neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting may be allowed if prior treatment with carboplatin was completed at least one year prior to initiation of this study and after discussion with the study chair
Gastric Carcinoma (including Gastro-Esophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma): progression following at least one prior line of standard therapy that contained a fluoropyrimidine and/or platinum and/or taxane agent; prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy is counted as one regimen, provided that disease progression occurs within 6 months after the completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy; HER2 negative subjects (defined by HER2 ? 2+ by IHC) by medical history; archival tissue or fresh tumor biopsy
Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for unresectable disease; patients with recurrence within 6 months of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy may be considered as having received one prior therapy for unresectable disease
Clinical need for adjuvant chemotherapy
Stereotactic radiation treatment of stage I disease or adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed at the discretion of treating physician for the participating subject
For adjuvant setting patients: Metastatic Disease (M+) prior to surgery
Received any adjuvant chemotherapy
For adjuvant setting patients, any treatment received after surgery

Have a primary diagnosis of non-metastatic colorectal cancer and have had surgery and are now receiving adjuvant chemotherapy
Patients must be planning to receive one of the study-allowed regimens as their initial treatment for their current disease; myelosuppressive therapy must follow the standard regimen, although a dose reduction of up to 10% is permitted; this treatment may be neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy; patients must not be receiving or planning to receive concurrent radiation during systemic treatment

Prior treatment with gemcitabine-containing therapy for advanced disease (adjuvant therapy is allowed, provided not more than six cycles were administered and relapse occurred more than six months after the last drug administration), and/or:
any neo-adjuvant therapy
Subjects previously treated with systemic therapies to treat cancer, such as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.
They show evidence of disease progression during or within 12 months of the end\n                  of adjuvant ET.
Subjects previously treated with systemic therapies to treat cancer, such as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.
For Adjuvant Treatment: No prior treatment with BTZ, CFZ, or IXZ
For the purposes of this study, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens do not count as a prior line of therapy.
