Patients with a history of prior treatment with an anti-programmed cell death (PD) 1 antibody, CD137 agonist or other immune activating therapy such as anti-CD 40 antibody are excluded unless 5 half-lives of the agent (minimum of 8 weeks) have intervened since the therapy; patients who have received prior vaccine therapy are eligible
Prior treatment with a CD137 agonist, ipilimumab, or the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor, or programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL-1) inhibitor
Backfill cohort enrollment may be limited to participants whose tumors have PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) and/or different levels of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) expression, as defined by the Sponsor
Backfill enrollment in Phase Ib may be managed such that approximately half of the patients in each backfill cohort will not have been trated with prior immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1/PD-1 [programmed death-1] and/or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]), except for those patients with tumor indications where cancer immunotherapy (CIT) is approved as treatment by local regulatory authorities Additional Inclusion Criteria for Participants in Each Indication-Specific Exploration/Expansion Cohort of Phase 1b:
Prior treatment with anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1)/Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or anti-CD137
Prior treatment with more than one line of cytotoxic chemotherapy; prior treatment with one line of cytotoxic chemotherapy is permitted; prior treatment with targeted therapy (such as ipilimumab, anti-programmed cell death 1 [PD1] and BRAF inhibitor) is permitted
Subjects who received other anti Cytotoxic T-lymphocytic antigen (CTLA-4) (non-ipilimumab) or other anti-Programmed death-1 (PD-1) (non-nivolumab) treatment
Documentation of program death ligand-1 (PD-L1) status prior to randomization.
Any major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, experimental therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drugs; for oral targeted therapies (such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, venetoclax), a washout of 3 days is allowed; Note: prior treatment with anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)20 monoclonal antibody, anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody and lenalidomide are allowed; prior treatment with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death (PD)1 therapies is allowed after a wash-out of 5 half-lives
Has received prior therapy with an anti-Programmed Cell Death Receptor 1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, anti-Programmed Cell Death Receptor Ligand 2 (PD-L2) agent or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell receptor or has previously participated in clinical studies with pembrolizumab
Prior treatment with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4), anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1), or anti-programmed death ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1) therapeutic antibody
Subjects who have received prior therapy with any T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways such as anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), anti-PD-L1, anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2), anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)137; or other medicines specifically targeting T cells are prohibited; prior therapy with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is permitted; prior interleukin (IL)-2 is permitted
Subjects must have programmed death-ligand 1 (PD -L1) immunohistochemical (IHC) testing, with results, performed by the central lab during the Screening period
Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1), anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1), or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (i.e., cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 [OX-40], necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9 [CD137]) or has previously participated in a Merck pembrolizumab (MK-3475) clinical trial.
Has received previous treatment with an immunomodulatory agent (e.g., anti-programmed cell death 1/ anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event
Prior treatment with any anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1, or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent; or with azacitidine (any formulation) or any other hypomethylating agent; or with anti-cytoplasmic (CD) 137, or anti-cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein (CTLA)-4 antibody (including ipilimumab) or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.

However, for dose escalation, prior treatment with the marketed inhibitors of the immune checkpoint pathway, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, is allowed. In addition, in each of the expansion cohorts, 6 response-evaluable participants with prior exposure to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents will be allowed to enroll.
Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1), anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T cell receptor (such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], OX-40, CD137) or has previously participated in Merck pembrolizumab (MK-3475) clinical studies.
Have received prior treatment with an anti PD-1, anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) agent.
