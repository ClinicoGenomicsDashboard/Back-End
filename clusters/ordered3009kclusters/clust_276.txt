Prior cancer treatment must be completed at least 14 days prior to registration for protocol therapy and the patient must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of the regimen. With the exception of Bevacizumab treatment, which must be completed 30 days prior to registration for protocol therapy.
Prior/Concurrent Therapy: Research participants must have recovered from the acute effects of prior treatment and:
Patient has not recovered from clinical and laboratory acute toxicities of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery
Previous chemotherapy, and/or biological therapy for cancer are permitted provided that the acoustic properties of the tumor were not affected, but the subject should have recovered from the effects of these or of any prior surgery
Received the last administration of an anticancer monoclonal antibody, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy (except nitrosoureas and mitomycin-C) =< 28 days prior to study registration or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy
Received the last administration of nitrosourea or mitomycin-C =< 42 days prior to study registration, or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy
Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study; at least 14 days must have elapsed from prior chemotherapy; at least 7 days must have elapsed since receiving biological therapy
Have not recovered from the adverse effects or toxicities of lymphoma therapy most recently administered
Patients must have fully recovered from the acute effects of all prior therapy
Recovered (that is, <= Grade 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy.
Patients having undergone recent resection (within 5 weeks prior to registration) of their glioblastoma to treat current recurrence prior to study treatment must have recovered from the effects of surgery (including patient's skin having fully recovered from the surgical wound) Note: a 4-week window is required after surgery prior to starting treatment. For CNS-related stereotactic biopsies, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to registration.
Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy at the time of registration as follows:
Participants who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events due to induction therapy; patients who have had localized radiation which would not result in any GI effects are allowed on study
Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy prior to entering study; three (3) weeks must have elapsed since the administration of prior chemotherapy
Patients must have completed mastectomy or breast-sparing surgery and must have recovered from all side effects of the surgery; if patients were treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, these treatments must be completed at least 28 days prior to study registration; patients should have recovered from all grade 2 or higher side effects of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy with the exception of alopecia and peripheral neuropathy; concurrent bisphosphonate and trastuzumab therapies are allowed
Recovered from the effects of any prior surgery or radiotherapy
Diseases refractory/relapsed after one or more systemic cytotoxic therapies; patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.
Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic therapy (with the exception of alopecia and Grade 1 neuropathy).
Resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior therapy.
Anti-cancer Agents: Subjects who are currently receiving other anticancer agents are not eligible. Subjects must have fully recovered from hematological and bone marrow suppression effects of prior chemotherapy.
Patient has recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy, and is at least 30 days from the most recent cytotoxic therapy, prior to enrollment
Anti-cancer Agents: Subjects who are currently receiving other anticancer agents are not eligible. Subjects must have fully recovered from the effects of prior chemotherapy (hematological and bone marrow suppression effects).
Anti-cancer Agents: Subjects who are currently receiving other anticancer agents are not eligible. Subjects must have fully recovered from the effects of prior chemotherapy (hematological and bone marrow suppression effects).
At the time of registration, subjects must have recovered from the toxic effects of previous treatments, as determined by the treating physician.
Patients who have received prior adjuvant high dose interferon are allowed to participate as long as the last injection was given at least 30 days prior to the C11-AMT PET scan and they have fully recovered from side effects (i.e., grade =< 1 or permanent side effects that require hormone replacement therapy)
Patient must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy or radiation prior to entering this study
Failure to have fully recovered (ie, =< grade 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects of prior chemotherapy
Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, cancer-related hormonetherapy, and investigational therapy) for at least 21 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving study drug and have recovered from the acute effects of therapy(treatment related toxicity resolved to baseline), except for residual alopecia
Recovered (that is, grade less than or equal to [<=] 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy.
Recovered (that is, less than or equal to [<=] Grade 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy.
Prior therapy: Must have recovered from acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy (durations relative to date of enrollment):
Recovered (that is, less than or equal to (<=) Grade 1 toxicity) from the effects of prior antineoplastic therapy.
Patients must have completed all previous anticancer therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to the first planned dose of omacetaxine, except as noted below, and must have fully recovered from side effects of a previous therapy.
Has not recovered to ? Grade 1 from toxic effects of prior therapy (including prior immunotherapy) and/or complications from prior surgical intervention before starting therapy.
Recovered (that is, <=Grade 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy.
Have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects of therapy.
