Patients must have been diagnosed with one of the following:\r\n* Primary brain tumor (glioma, glioblastoma [GBM] etc); or\r\n* Up to 10 brain metastases
Patients must be scheduled to undergo standard brain cancer interventions:\r\n* Chemotherapy or targeted antiangiogenic therapy, in the case of primary brain tumor; or\r\n* Stereotaxic radiotherapy (SRS) or whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), in the case of brain metastases
Participants with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study
Known brain metastases
Patients with symptomatic brain metastases are excluded from this study.
Known brain metastases
All subjects with brain metastases, except those meeting the following criteria:\r\n* Brain metastases that have been treated locally and are clinically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment \r\n* No ongoing neurological symptoms that are related to the brain localization of the disease (sequelae that are a consequence of the treatment of the brain metastases are acceptable)\r\n* Subjects must be either off steroids or on a stable or decreasing dose of =< 10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent), excluding dexamethasone given as pre-treatment for trabectedin
Active or progressing brain metastases
Patients with known brain metastases
Untreated brain metastases
Clinically active brain metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms. Subjects with treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment with steroids may be included in the study if they have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy. A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed between the end of whole brain radiotherapy and study enrollment (2 weeks for stereotactic radiotherapy).
Presence of gliomas and brain metastases only if neurologically stable and treated without ongoing requirement for corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks.
Symptomatic, progressive or corticosteroids-requiring documented brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease involvement.
Brain metastases allowed if asymptomatic, without edema, and not receiving corticosteroids or radiation
The patient has a histologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard measures do not exist or are no longer effective. (Patients with primary brain cancer or lymphoma are permitted. Patients with brain metastases are allowed if whole brain radiation was performed and is documented stable for ? 6 weeks)
Has active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Participants with brain metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration. There must also be no requirement for high doses of systemic corticosteroids that could result in immunosuppression (greater than [>] 10 milligram per day [mg/day] prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.
Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms
Subjects with detectable cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells or brain metastases or with a history of cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells or brain metastases
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment; this exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability
Patients with primary brain tumors or primary tumors with central nervous system metastases as only location of disease. Controlled brain metastases are permitted
Has active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable brain metastases and did not receive chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.
Subjects with any evidence of distant metastases
Participants must not have symptomatic brain metastases or brain metastases requiring steroids; asymptomatic brain metastases not requiring steroids are acceptable
Brain metastases allowed if asymptomatic at study baseline. Patients with untreated brain metastases must not be on corticosteroids. If patients have neurological symptoms or signs due to CNS metastases, patients need to complete whole brain radiation or focal treatment at least 14 days before start of study treatment and be asymptomatic on stable or decreasing doses of corticosteroids at baseline.
CNS tumor or clinically active brain metastases.
Brain metastases have been treated.
Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial; patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for >= 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases are eligible to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator
Participants with known brain metastases who have completed whole brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery or complete surgical resection, will be eligible if they have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic, and off steroids for one month.
Patients with brain metastases may participate if they have undergone appropriate treatment for the lesion(s), are at least two weeks post treatment without evidence for post-treatment progression, have no significant neurologic symptoms, and no longer require steroids for the reason of brain metastases
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable (i.e., without evidence of progression by repeat imaging), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for ?14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
Brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms, as well as any history of radiation, surgery, or other therapy, including steroids, to control symptoms from brain metastases within 1 month (30 days) of enrollment.
Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis; subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and also are off steroids 3 days prior to dosing with study medication; stable brain metastases by this definition should be established prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab
Symptomatic brain metastases
Patients with known untreated and uncontrolled brain metastases are excluded. However, brain-imaging studies are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurological signs or symptoms.
Patient has a primary neoplasm of the brain or known uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS). Patients with brain metastases are eligible, provided they have shown clinical and radiographically stable disease for at least 4 weeks after definitive therapy and have not used steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of PRN1371.
