Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); the World Health Organization (WHO) classification will be used to sub-classify the NHL; original pathology reports will be used to confirm eligibility; review of biopsy tissue slides will be attempted, but not necessary for eligibility
