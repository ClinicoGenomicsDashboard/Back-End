Presence of measurable or non-measurable disease.
Measurable disease
Symptomatic, histologically confirmed MM, based on IMWG guidelines. Patients must have measurable disease as defined by at least one of the following:
Patients must have bi-dimensional measurable disease
Histologically confirmed diagnosis, measurable disease and evidence of disease progression of MM.
Symptomatic MM, based on IMWG guidelines. Patients must have measurable disease.
Evidence of measurable or evaluable disease
Must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease
Has measurable disease (or evaluable if not in MTD expansion cohort) via computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with or without non-measurable tumors (a lesion in a previously irradiated area is eligible to be considered as measurable disease as long as there is objective evidence of progression of that lesion prior to enrollment)
COHORT A SPECIFIC INCLUSION: Measurable disease on imaging (1 cm) or measurable non-enhancing tumor
Measurable disease per IWG 2007 criteria.
Have measurable disease based on modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT); tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions
Radiographically or clinically measurable disease with at least 1 target lesion per International Working Group (IWG) criteria for malignant lymphoma.
Radiologically measurable disease meeting the following criteria:
For Parts A and B, participants must have evaluable or measurable disease
Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Palpable lesions that are not measurable by radiographic or photographic evaluations may not be utilized as the only measurable lesion. Any measurable lesion biopsied at Screening cannot be followed as a target/index lesion unless agreed upon by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
Disease may be measurable or non-measurable
Measurable disease with obstruction into the airway
GENERAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBPROTOCOLS: At the time of treatment with subprotocol specified therapy, the patients must have radiographically measurable disease; patients with neuroblastoma who do not have measurable disease but have iobenguane (MIBG) positive (+) evaluable are eligible; measurable disease in patients with CNS involvement is defined as tumor that is measurable in two perpendicular diameters on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visible on more than one slice\r\n* Note: The following do not qualify as measurable disease:\r\n** Malignant fluid collections (e.g., ascites, pleural effusions)\r\n** Bone marrow infiltration except that detected by MIBG scan for neuroblastoma\r\n** Lesions only detected by nuclear medicine studies (e.g., bone, gallium or positron emission tomography [PET] scans) except as noted for neuroblastoma\r\n** Elevated tumor markers in plasma or CSF \r\n** Previously radiated lesions that have not demonstrated clear progression post radiation \r\n** Leptomeningeal lesions that do not meet the measurement requirements for Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1
Measurable disease on preoperative imaging
Patients who have measurable disease after diagnostic biopsy
Measurable disease – minimum lesion size of 8 x 3 mm before initial biopsy
Measurable disease
Must have measurable or evaluable disease
At least one site of measurable disease
Participants must have measurable or evaluable disease
Measurable disease
Measurable disease, including at least one of the following:
Measurable disease as per IMWG response criteria
Extramedullary disease in the absence of any measurable medullary involvement
Subjects must have measurable disease
Participants must have measurable brain disease, defined as at least one lesion that is 10 mm in diameter
Disease that is measurable; this is defined as lesions measuring at least 10 mm on radiologic imaging
Participants in the Kinetic Studies Arm cannot have non-measurable disease (< 1 cm) by CT
All patients must have measurable or evaluable disease
Patients must have measurable residual disease at the primary site, after surgery or at relapse as estimated by imaging
Patient must have measurable residual disease, defined as tumor that is measurable in two perpendicular diameters on MRI; diffuse leptomeningeal disease is not considered measurable
Measurable disease.
Histologically confirmed MM with measurable disease per IMWG guidelines as defined by at least 1 of the following:
Have measurable disease based on irRECIST
Measurable disease (assessed within 28 days prior to day 1)
Patients who only have non-measurable disease
Radiographic evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease; lesions will be considered measurable or non-measurable as per definitions provided in RECIST version 1.1
Measurable disease on CT scan
Measurable disease (at least one lesion on radiographic or exam assessment measuring >= 2 cm in longest axis)
Measurable Disease:
Part 2, Expansion: Participants must have measurable disease meeting the following criteria: i. Subjects with HCC: At least 1 measurable target lesion according to mRECIST
Measurable or non-measurable disease will be allowed
For Participants with MM, measurable disease defined as one of the following:
Measurable or evaluable disease
The participant has measurable or non-measurable disease.
At least one measurable lesion per revised IWG Response Criteria
At least one lesion with measurable disease at baseline
Measurable disease as per modified RECIST 1.1 • A lesion in an area that was previously treated with local therapy (e.g. radiation, surgery, or cryotherapy) can be considered measurable disease as long as there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to randomization
Presence of measurable disease
Confirmed measurable disease
At least one measurable lesion
