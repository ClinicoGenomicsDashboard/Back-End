History of bleeding disorder or hemorrhagic stroke
active, bleeding diathesis;
History of bleeding/coagulation problems
active bleeding or at high risk of bleeding
The patient has a lack of bleeding disorders, and
Bleeding disorder
Patients with or with a history of uncontrolled bleeding diathesis
No history of bleeding diathesis
History of major bleeding with bronchoscopy
Major surgery or significant bleeding episodes within 28 days before study initiation\r\n* Major surgery does not include: breast or other biopsies obtained for diagnosis, placement of radio-opaque clip to localize a tumor or tumors for subsequent surgical resection, placement of central venous access, pretreatment lymph node sampling\r\n* Significant bleeding episodes are defined for the purpose of this study as hemoptysis or upper/lower gastrointestinal bleeding\r\n* Although bevacizumab will be administered in tracer quantities in this study and is not expected to have pharmacologic effects, participants with major surgery or significant bleeding episodes within 28 days before study initiation may be at a higher risk of bleeding
Patient must not have evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis
Active vaginal bleeding requiring packing and emergent radiation therapy
Participants must lack bleeding disorders, and be able to provide informed consent; the latter two criteria will be assessed from the patient’s history and the consenting interview
Lack bleeding disorders
Known inherited or acquired bleeding disorders.
Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand’s disease) or hemophilia
Evidence of mucosal or internal bleeding and/or is platelet transfusion refractory
Known bleeding disorder that cannot be sufficiently corrected with co-fact or fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding
Bleeding disorders
Any condition resulting in increased risk of bleeding at biopsy.
History of any coagulation, bleeding, or blood disorders (e.g. anemia)
No known bleeding disorders
No active bleeding
No active bleeding in the post-operative period
Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding
History or presence of significant bleeding disorders
Known bleeding diathesis or history of abnormal bleeding, or any other known coagulation abnormalities that would contraindicate the tumor biopsy procedure.
Bleeding and Thrombosis:
If active bleeding requiring acute surgical intervention, not eligible
History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to CML
The patient has uncontrolled or severe coagulopathies or a history of clinically significant bleeding within the past 6 months, such as hemoptysis, epistaxis, hematochezia, hematuria, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient has a known predisposition for bleeding such as von Willebrand's disease or other such condition.
Known presence of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer
Mucosal or internal bleeding, or platelet transfusion refractory
Known bleeding diathesis or history of abnormal bleeding, or any other known coagulation abnormalities that would contraindicate the tumor biopsy procedure.
Bleeding or thrombotic disorders.
Active bleeding or pathologic condition that carries a high risk of bleeding
Tumors located in the central chest or other location where bleeding is associated with high morbidity
