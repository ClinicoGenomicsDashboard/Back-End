Urine protein: creatinine (UPC) ratio < 1 or urine dipstick for proteinuria =< 2+ (note: if the UPC ratio is >= 1.0 then a 24-hour urine collection should be performed and this must demonstrate =< 1g of protein in 24 hours)
Proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by urinalysis with proteinuria ? 2+ (patients discovered to have ?2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and must demonstrate ? 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).
Proteinuria with urinary protein is =< 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis, or a 24-hour urine collection for protein < 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours, within 28 days prior to administration of study treatment
STEP I: Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease as defined by having one or more of the following, obtained within 28 days prior to randomization:\r\n* >= 1 g/dL monoclonal protein (M-protein) on serum protein electrophoresis\r\n* >= 200 mg/24 hours (hrs) of monoclonal protein on a 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis\r\n* Involved free light chain >= 10 mg/dL or >= 100 mg/L AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain ratio (< 0.26 or > 1.65)\r\n* Monoclonal bone marrow plasmacytosis >= 30% (evaluable disease)\r\n* Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and serum free light chain (FLC) assay are required to be performed within 28 days prior to randomization; a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate is required within 28 days if bone marrow is being followed for response\r\n** NOTE: UPEP (on a 24-hour collection) is required, no substitute method is acceptable; urine must be followed monthly if the baseline urine M-spike is >= 200 mg/24 hr; please note that if both serum and urine M-components are present, both must be followed in order to evaluate response\r\n** NOTE: The serum free light chain test is required to be done if the patient does not have measurable disease in the serum or urine; measurable disease in the serum is defined as having a serum M-spike >= 1 g/dL; measurable disease in the urine is defined as having a urine M-spike >= 200 mg/24 hr
Baseline urinalysis should show urine protein < 3+ and must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration; if urine protein is 3+ or greater, then urine protein by 24 hour collection must show less than 3 grams of protein
Within 2 weeks prior to registration: Screening urine dipstick must equal 0 or “trace”; if urine dipstick results are >= 1+, or if dipstick was not performed, calculation of urine protein creatinine (UPC) is required and patients must have a UPC ratio =< 1 to participate in the study
Urine protein creatinine (UPC) =< 1; if UPC >= 1, then a 24-hour urine protein must be assessed; eligible patients must have a 24-hour urine protein value < 1 g/L
Within 14 days prior to registration: Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio must be < 1.0 gm; if UPC ratio >= 1, collection of 24-hour urine measurement of urine protein is recommended (24-hour urine protein level must be < 1000 mg for patient enrollment); UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24-hour urine protein excretion – a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm
Participants must have disease that is measurable by either serum or urine evaluation of the monoclonal component or by assay of serum free light chains or by minimal residual detection; measurable disease is defined as one or more of the following:\r\n* Serum M protein > 0.5 G/DL, or\r\n* Urine M protein > 200 MG/24H, and/or\r\n* Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level > 10 MG/DL with abnormal serum FLC ratio\r\n* >= 50 plasma cells detectable by multicolor flow cytometry, at a sensitive level of 10^-4 (determined by central review)
A urine sample tested for proteinuria by the dipstick method must indicate 0 -1+ protein; if dipstick reading is >= 2+, a 24-hour urine specimen must demonstrate < 1.0 g of protein per 24 hours
Patient must have measurable disease or non-measurable disease, defined as one or more of the following holding true:\r\n* Measurable disease:\r\n** Serum M-protein >= 1.0 g/dL (>= 0.5 g/dL for IgA or IgM myeloma) and/or\r\n** Urine M-protein >= 200 mg/24 hours and/or\r\n** Involved serum free light chain level >= 10 mg/dL AND an abnormal serum free light chain ratio\r\n* For non-measurable disease:\r\n** Baseline marrow burden of myeloma of at least 30%
RE-REGISTRATION ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (STEP 2): Patient must have measurable disease or non-measurable disease after progression on pomalidomide + dexamethasone, defined as one or more of the following holding true:\r\n* Measurable disease:\r\n** Serum M-protein >= 0.5 g/dL and/or\r\n** Urine M-protein >= 200 mg/24 hours and/or\r\n** Involved serum free light chain level >= 10 mg/dL AND an abnormal serum free light chain ratio\r\n* For non-measurable disease:\r\n** Marrow burden of myeloma of at least 30%
