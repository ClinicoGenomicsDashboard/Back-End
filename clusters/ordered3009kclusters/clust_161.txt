Cardiovascular baseline corrected QT by Fridericia's (QTcF) > 450 msec (male) or QTcF > 470 msec (female) will exclude patients from entry on study
A corrected QT interval >=480 msec (e.g. Bazett's formula [QTcB])
QTcF interval > 450 msec (males) or > 470 msec (females)
Serious cardiac condition such as myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, unstable angina, or Class III or IV congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA); have ECG abnormalities including baseline 12-lead ECG with Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) > 470 msec (female) or > 450 msec (male), a history of congenital long QT syndrome, or any ECG abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude safe participation in the study
Current long QT syndrome or baseline prolongation of QT/QTcF interval, i.e. demonstration of a QTcF interval > 450 msec
Prolonged corrected QT interval by the Fridericia correction formula (QTcF) on the Electrocardiogram (ECG) > 470 msec.
Must have a QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) <470 milli seconds (msec) or <480 msec with bundle branch block.
Normal ejection fraction (echocardiogram [ECHO] or cardiac MRI) >= 53% (or the institutional normal; if a range is given then the upper value of the range will be used); corrected QT (QTC) or Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) =< 450 msec
Pretreatment QTcF interval >470 msec (females) or >450 msec (males)
A baseline ECG QTcF > 470 msec
At Screening, QTcF >450 msec for males; QTcF >470 msec for females
QTcF interval < 450 msec and mean resting heart rate 50-90 bpm
Fridericia's corrected QT (QTcF) prolongation > 470 ms or QT prolongation deemed clinically relevant by the investigator (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome); the QTcF will be calculated as the mean of the 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken at screening\r\n* NOTE: The formula used to calculate QTcF can be physician’s choice, but it must be used consistently throughout the study
Subject has electrocardiogram (ECG) showing clinically significant abnormality at screening or an average QTc interval (Fridercia's or Bazett's formula) >450 msec in males and >470 msec in females (>480 msec for subjects with Bundle Branch Block (BBB)).
Friderichia corrected QT interval (QTcF) >450 milliseconds (msec) (men) or >475 msec (women) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during the Screening period.
Prolongation of QTcF interval to >480 milliseconds (msec)
QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) <450 milliseconds (msec) or QTcF <480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block.
Fridericia's Heart Rate Correction Formula (QTcF) interval >450 msec;
QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) >450 milliseconds
Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) =< 470 msec
Patients with a QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) > 450 msec (QTcF > 480 msec for patients with bundle branch block)
Prolongation of the corrected QT interval by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval defined as > 450 msec for males and > 470 msec for females
Impaired cardiac function including any one of the following: complete left bundle branch block or use of a permanent cardiac pacemaker, congenital long QT syndrome, presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, clinically significant resting bradycardia (< 50 beats per minute), QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) > 450 msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG), or right bundle branch block + left anterior hemiblock (bifascicular block)
Subject has QTcF interval > 450 msec (average of triplicate determinations based on central reading).
QTc > 450 msec on the average of three serial baseline ECG (using the QTcF formula). If QTcF > 450 msec and electrolytes are not within normal ranges, electrolytes should be corrected and then the patient re-tested for QTc.This exclusion criterion is not applicable for patients with non-measurable QT interval who have evidence of measurable QT interval at the time of CML diagnosis (e.g. prior to first start of TKI treatment) and who have no documented clinical signs of cardiovascular disease and/or clinical signs of conduction abnormality.
Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) >450 milliseconds (msec) (men) or >475 msec (women) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during the Screening period.
