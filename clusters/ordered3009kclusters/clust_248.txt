Histologically-confirmed stage 4 NSCLC that: has not been treated with prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and has high PD-L1 expression (ie, a TPS ? 50%), as determined by an FDA-approved test. Previous neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed if completed ? 6 months before diagnosis of metastatic disease.The subject's tumor must not harbor an EGFR sensitizing (activating) mutation or ALK translocation. EGFR sensitizing mutations are those mutations that are amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors including erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib. Investigators must be able to produce the source documentation of the EGFR mutation and ALK translocation status in all subjects with non-squamous histologies AND for subjects in whom testing is clinically recommended. If either an EGFR sensitizing mutation of ALK translocation is detected, additional information regarding the mutation status of the other molecule is not required. If unable to test for these molecular changes, formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue of any age should be submitted to a central laboratory designated by the Sponsor for such testing. Subjects with non-squamous histologies will not be randomized until the EGFR mutation status and/or ALK translocation status is available in source documentation at the site. For patients enrolled who are known to have a tumor of predominantly squamous histology, molecular testing for EGFR and ALK translocation will not be required as this is not standard of care and is not part of current diagnostic guidelines.

Patients with EGFR mutations expected to be sensitive to EGFR inhibitors and patients with EML4/ALK translocations are excluded, unless all available Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved targeted therapy options have been utilized; for example, a patient with exon 19 EGFR mutation who has never been treated with an EGFR inhibitor would be excluded; patients with other sensitizing mutations that become actionable with FDA-approved targeted therapies during the course of this trial (e.g., crizotinib for MET deletion 14) will also be expected to have utilized all available FDA-approved targeted therapy options prior to eligibility\r\n* Note: In contrast to the above, a patient with an EGFR mutation who has been treated with a first-generation and third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and then with four cycles of carboplatin plus pemetrexed would be eligible
Patients with EGFR and ALK alterations should have been treated with at least 1 line of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
