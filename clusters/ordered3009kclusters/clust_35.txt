Patients must either be eligible to be screened at progression on prior treatment or to be pre-screened prior to progression on current treatment; patients will either consent to the screening consent or the pre-screening consent, not both; these criteria are:\r\n* Screening at progression on prior treatment: to be eligible for screening at progression, patients must have received at least one line of systemic therapy for any stage of disease (stages I-IV) and must have progressed during or following their most recent line of therapy; for patients whose prior systemic therapy was for stage I-III disease only (i.e. patient has not received any treatment for stage IV or recurrent disease), the prior systemic therapy must have been a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and disease progression on the platinum-based chemotherapy must have occurred within one year from the last date that patient received that therapy; for patients whose prior therapy was for stage IV or recurrent disease, the patient must have received at least one line of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or checkpoint inhibitor therapy (e.g. nivolumab or pembrolizumab)\r\n* Pre-screening prior to progression on current treatment: to be eligible for pre-screening, current treatment must be for stage IV or recurrent disease and patient must have received at least one dose of the current regimen; patients must have previously received or currently be receiving a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen or checkpoint inhibitor therapy (e.g. nivolumab or pembrolizumab); patients on first-line platinum-based treatment are eligible upon receiving cycle 1, day 1 infusion; Note: patients will not receive their sub-study assignment until they progress and the S1400 Notice of Progression is submitted
