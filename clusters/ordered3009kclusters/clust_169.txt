Has measureable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
Subjects must have measurable disease by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria; to comply with PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) criteria, subjects should have at least one lesion measuring at least 2 cm in the longest diameter
Presence of at least one measurable lesion according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)
Subjects are required to have measurable disease that has progressed through prior therapy and that includes a non-hepatic lesion for imaging that is >= 1.5 cm, as defined by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion at baseline by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria
At least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.
Has measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria at presentation
Measurable disease according to RECIST v.1.1 (or Choi criteria and/or EORTC metabolic response criteria for solid tumors, in the case of GIST); or
Additional Inclusion Requirements for expansion cohorts only a) Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Version 1.1) and at least 1 nonsignificant risk, non-target lesion accessible for biopsy per the guidelines above (for TAK-580 + nivolumab and TAK-202 (plozalizumab) + nivolumab only).
