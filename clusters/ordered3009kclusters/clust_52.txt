Not currently receiving anticoagulation therapy
Coagulation parameters\t(international normalized ratio [INR], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) =< 1.25 x institutional limits, except where a lupus anti-coagulant has been confirmed or the patient is on warfarin; patients on full dose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose for at least 14 days. If receiving warfarin, the patient must have an INR =< 3.0 without any evidence of active bleeding within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment or a pathologic condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (tumor involvement with major blood vessels or varicies), within 28 days prior to administration of study treatment
Patients must not have any serious or unstable pre-existing medical conditions (aside from malignancy exceptions specified above), including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics on day 1, history of bleeding diathesis or need for concurrent anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] =< 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time [PTT] within 1.1 x ULN), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, interfere with subject’s safety, or obtaining informed consent; therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of prothrombin time (PT)/INR by the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate; prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency

Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists (e.g. phenprocoumon)
For patients requiring anti-coagulation with vitamin K antagonists, therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site. Exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR. Consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate. If clinically indicated, prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency.

Patients receiving chronic or acute warfarin treatment are not excluded, but should be monitored very closely or considered for switch to other therapies.
