History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors for RVO (e.g. uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes).
A history or current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or Central serous retinopathy (CSR) including
Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic examination that is considered a risk factor for RVO or CSR such as evidence of new optic disc cupping; Evidence of new visual field defects on automated perimetry; Intraocular pressure >21 mmHg as measured by tonography
History or concurrent evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors for RVO.
History of or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO).
Unacceptable ocular/retinal conditions
History of retinal vein occlusion, central serous retinopathy or glaucoma.
Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmologic exam that is considered a risk factor for retinal vein occlusion or central serous retinopathy.
No underlying ocular/retinal pathology.
History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or predisposing factors to RVO (e.g. uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes)
History of retinal degenerative disease
A history or current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR) including:\r\n* Presence of predisposing factors to RVO or CSR (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or a history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes)
History or evidence of retinal pathology according to protocol-defined criteria, including serous retinopathy
