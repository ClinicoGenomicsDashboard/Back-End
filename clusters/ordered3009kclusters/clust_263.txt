Any documented donor-derived PTLD
Has undergone 1 allo-HSCT from any donor (related or unrelated with any degree of HLA matching) and any donor source (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood) for a hematologic malignancy or disorder. Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens are eligible.
7. Patients are eligible if no formal unrelated donor search has been activated prior to date of consent. A formal unrelated donor search begins at the time at which samples are requested from potential National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donors. Patients who have started a sibling donor search or who have found a matched sibling donor are eligible.
Intent to proceed with RIC alloHCT if a matched sibling or matched unrelated donor is identified. There is no requirement as to the timing of the transplantation.
A suitable donor must be identified; there are no restrictions on donor type and can include a matched sibling, a matched or mismatched unrelated donor, a family haplotype matched donor or a cord blood donor (single or double)
A positive cross-match exists between the donor and recipient
DONOR: If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class I locus or II locus, the donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must match the patient (i.e., patient is homozygous A*01:01 and donor is heterozygous A*01:01, A*02:01); this mismatch will be considered a one-antigen mismatch for rejection only
DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the donor should be excluded if any of the flow cytometric B and T cell cytotoxic cross match assays are positive
DONOR: Only filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source on this protocol
DONOR: Donor (or centers) who will exclusively donate marrow
DONOR: Donors who are HIV-positive and/or, medical conditions that would result in increased risk for G-CSF mobilization and harvest of PBSC
DONOR: Patients who are homozygous at the mismatched HLA class I locus or II locus, the donor is excluded if homozygous at the mismatched locus (i.e., patient is homozygous A*01:01 and donor is homozygous A*02:01); this type of mismatch is considered a two-antigen mismatch and is not allowed
Prior transfusions from selected donor
DONOR: When more than one donor is available, the donor with the lowest number of HLA allele mismatches will be chosen, unless there is HLA cross-match incompatibility or a medical reason to select otherwise, in which case donor selection is the responsibility of the principal investigator (PI), in consultation with the immunogenetics laboratory; in cases where there is more than one donor with the least degree of mismatch, donors will be selected based on the most favorable combination of (i) HLA compatibility in cross-match testing and (ii) ABO compatibility; will prioritize the lowest number of mismatches in the host-versus-graft (HVG) direction (to potentially minimize graft rejection risk)
DONOR SELECTION CRITERIA, IN DECREASING ORDER OF PRIORITY:
DONOR: Donor must be medically, socially, and psychologically fit to donate
DONOR: For a partially HLA-mismatched transplant, the patient must lack antibodies against donor HLA molecules; specifically, complement dependent cytotoxicity and flow cytometric crossmatch assays must be negative, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of any anti-donor HLA antibody by solid phase immunoassay should be < 3000; consult with Immunogenetics for the clinical significance of any anti-donor antibody; desensitization to remove anti-donor antibody should only be performed for patients who have no other donor options
DONOR: If there is more than one donor with the least amount of HVG allele mismatches, the following prioritization will be used: (will always minimize HVG mismatch as highest priority)\r\n* ABO compatibility (in order of priority)\r\n** Compatible or minor ABO incompatibility\r\n** Major ABO incompatibility\r\n* Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status\r\n** The CMV status of the pair donor-recipient is frequently employed to select a potential donor; this is a controversial issue and the data available is somewhat limited; the following guidelines are recommended:\r\n*** For a CMV seronegative recipient, use a CMV seronegative donor\r\n*** For a CMV seropositive recipient, use a CMV seropositive donor\r\n* In CMV- patients with CMV+ stem-cell donors, primary CMV infection/reactivation develops in about 30%; data from the European Registry shows the following: seropositive patients receiving grafts from CMV+ HLA-identical sibling donors had the same survival as patients grafted from CMV- donors; however, matched unrelated donor (MUD) recipients receiving grafts from CMV+ donors had an improved 5-year survival, an improved event-free survival, and a reduced transplant-related mortality; there was no influence on the relapse incidence; the effects of donor CMV status remained in multivariate analyses; the effect of donor status was different among different disease categories; in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, T-cell depletion abrogated the beneficial effect of donor status, suggesting that the effect is mediated through transfer of donor immunity; these data suggest that donor CMV status influences outcome of unrelated stem cell transplant (SCT)
DONOR: The cytomegalovirus (CMV) status of the pair donor-recipient is frequently employed to select a potential donor; the following guidelines are recommended:\r\n* For a CMV seronegative recipient, use a CMV seronegative donor\r\n* For a CMV seropositive recipient, use a CMV seropositive donor
DONOR: Donor parity and sex mismatch, have also been associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and decreased survival in some but not all studies; donor age and weight should be also taken into consideration\r\n* Suggestions (in no order of priority):\r\n** Younger (18 years of age or older) and lighter donors should be preferred\r\n* If all else is equal, male donors may be preferred over nulliparous female donors who may be preferred over multiparous female donors\r\n* Other factors such as donor age and health history will be integrated into the donor selection process per standard practice and may be prioritized over HLA, ABO and CMV status; children donors may be used if appropriate

EBV-specific T-cells from donor of the patient's transplant are not available
EBV-specific T-cells are available for adoptive immune cell therapy from a consenting third party donor; the third party EBV CTLs to be administered will be selected on the basis of two criteria: 1) that they are matched for at least 2 HLA antigens and 2) that they are restricted by an allele shared with the EBV+ malignancy (if known), or with the donor in HSCT recipients, or patient in organ transplant or immunodeficient patients
Patients developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplant (HSCT) (ie: marrow, peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC], or umbilical cord blood); in these cases, the HSCT donor, if EBV-seropositive, will be used as the donor of EBV-specific T-cells for adoptive immunotherapy wherever possible, because the EBV-LPD are almost invariably derived from that marrow donor; these patients will be enrolled onto protocol Institutional Review Board (IRB) # 95-024; however, if the HSCT donor is EBV seronegative or not readily available (e.g. a cord blood transplant), the patient will be a candidate to receive EBV-specific T-cells generated from a third party seropositive donor that have been generated and stored in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) bank of cryopreserved immune T-cells for adoptive cell therapy; for these patients, the third party donor derived T cells to be used will be selected primarily on the basis of 1) matching for, at least, 2 HLA antigens and 2) one restricted allele shared by the transplant donor and recipient; however, priority is given to T cells partially HLA antigen matched with, and restricted by, HLA alleles of the transplant donor, since EBV + lymphomas in HSCT recipients are usually (but not always) derived from the transplant donors' cells

DONOR: HIV-positive donors
DONOR: Donors who are cross-match positive with recipient
DONOR INCLUSION: The donor of WT-1 specific T lymphocytes will be the same donor who provided the patient's hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
DONOR INCLUSION: Re-evaluation for this blood donation will be limited to a clinical history, physical examination and blood tests to insure against any new condition which, in the opinion of the donor's physician, precludes the donor from donating the blood required
DONOR EXCLUSION: New health conditions which would exclude a transplant donor from a second blood donation are limited, but include:\r\n* New onset of an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\r\n* Other uncontrolled infection which could be transmitted to the patient by blood cells and would place the patient at significant increased risk of severe morbidity or death\r\n* Significant anemia with hemoglobin (Hgb) =< 10 gm/dl, persisting since the time of the original transplant donation\r\n* History of myocardial infarction or stroke since the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) donation which might increase the risk of blood donation
