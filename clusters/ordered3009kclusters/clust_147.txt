Within 60 days after bone marrow biopsy confirmed remission after the patients recover from their last course of chemotherapy, the goal will be to consent the eligible patient prior to the remission confirmation bone marrow biopsy at the end of the planned chemotherapy); ideally, the research samples will be collected during the bone marrow biopsy, and the patient will be enrolled to the study within 2 weeks of the bone marrow biopsy; if there is delay to enroll the patient after the bone marrow biopsy and research sample collection, it is ok not to repeat bone marrow biopsy within 4 weeks, after the last bone marrow biopsy, if there is no sign of disease relapse; a repeat bone marrow biopsy should be done if the delay of enrollment is more than 4 weeks after the last bone marrow biopsy; patients with confirmed remission within 60 days after the last bone marrow biopsy, without research samples collection, should have a repeat bone marrow biopsy conducted within two weeks prior to enrolling on the study

WITHOUT ADEQUATE BASELINE SAMPLES, PATIENTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE TREATED AND RANDOMIZED ON THIS PROTOCOL; IF A BONE MARROW ASPIRATE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR LTRL SUBMISSION AT BASELINE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT DR PAIETTA FROM THE LTRL IS CALLED TO DISCUSS THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD WBC AND BLAST COUNT BEFORE BLOOD ONLY IS SUBMITTED\r\n* NOTE: Hydroxyurea can be given for up to 5 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy for control of leukocyte count and/or other symptoms or signs; corticosteroids can be given after pre-registration to the protocol and submission of baseline marrow and blood samples for control of leukocyte count and/or other symptoms or signs prior to initiation of protocol therapy if needed; if corticosteroids are given prior to pre-registration, contact the study chair as the patient may still be eligible to participate
New diagnosis of B lineage ALL must be made upon bone marrow or peripheral blood immunophenotyping; cases with myeloid antigen expression, but unequivocal lymphoid immunophenotype, are eligible
Mature B ALL (Burkitt’s-like leukemia) is excluded from enrollment in this trial; pre-study bone marrow biopsy and aspirate must be completed =< 1 week prior to registration
Bone marrow aspirates must be submitted for centralized minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment performed by the ECOG-ACRIN Leukemia Translational Research Laboratory
MRD results will be reported to the submitting institution\r\n* NOTE: FOR MRD ASSESSMENTS, AN ASPIRATE FROM A SEPARATE BONE MARROW ASPIRATION SITE MUST BE SUBMITTED (THE NEEDLE CAN BE RE-DIRECTED THROUGH THE SAME SKIN PUNCTURE SITE); ONLY SUBMIT ASPIRATES FROM THE FIRST PULL OF AN ASPIRATION SITE FOR MRD TESTING; DO NOT SUBMIT SAMPLES FROM THE SECOND OR THIRD PULL OF THE SAME ASPIRATION SITE \r\n* In B-lineage ALL, MRD levels in peripheral blood or from a dilute marrow aspiration can be 300% lower, on average, than those in bone marrow at a given time point; submitting a first pull from a separate aspiration site will ensure that MRD determinations used in randomization and trial interpretation are accurate\r\n** NOTE: failure to submit bone marrow aspirates will result in a major violation at the time of an audit

Patients with histologic diagnosis (by institutional pathologist) of newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) arising from bone or soft tissue and with metastatic disease involving lung, bone, bone marrow, or other metastatic site
For the purpose of this study metastatic disease is defined as one or more of the following:\r\n* Lesions which are discontinuous from the primary tumor, are not regional lymph nodes, and do not share a bone or body cavity with the primary tumor; skip lesions in the same bone as the primary tumor do not constitute metastatic disease; skip lesions in an adjacent bone are considered bone metastases; if there is any doubt whether lesions are metastatic, a biopsy of those lesions should be performed\r\n* Contralateral pleural effusion and/or contralateral pleural nodules\r\n* Distant lymph node involvement\r\n* Patients with pulmonary nodules are considered to have metastatic disease if the patient has:\r\n** Solitary nodule >= 0.5 cm or multiple nodules of >= 0.3 cm unless lesion is biopsied and negative for tumor\r\n** Patients with solitary nodule < 0.5 cm or multiple nodules < 0.3 cm are not considered to have lung metastasis unless biopsy documents tumor\r\n* Bone marrow metastatic disease is based on morphologic evidence of Ewing sarcoma based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains; in the absence of morphologic evidence of marrow involvement on H&E, patients with bone marrow involvement detected ONLY by flow cytometry, reverse-transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or immunohistochemistry will NOT be considered to have clinical bone marrow involvement for the purposes of this study\r\n** This study requires bilateral bone marrow biopsies at study entry; the suggested approach for patients with large pelvic tumors in which a posterior iliac crest bone marrow biopsy would track through the tumor is to instead undergo 2 marrow biopsies on the contralateral side (either 2 posterior biopsies or one posterior and one anterior biopsy)\r\n* Bone metastasis: This study utilizes whole body FDG-PET scans to screen patients for bone metastases; areas suspicious for bone metastasis based on FDG-PET scans require confirmatory anatomic imaging with either MRI or computed tomography (CT) (whole body FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/magnetic resonance [MR] scan acceptable); whole body technetium bone scans may be performed at the discretion of the investigator and are not required; for patients without other sites of metastatic disease whose sole metastatic site to qualify for study entry is a single area suspicious for bone metastasis identified by FDG-PET, confirmatory biopsy or anatomic imaging evidence of an associated soft tissue mass at that site is required for study entry

Registration Step 3 – Maintenance: Patients must have documented CR or CRi within 28 days prior to registration; note that bone marrow examination is only required if there are clinical signs/symptoms of progression; if progression is a concern due to the length of the time for count recovery, a bone marrow examination is recommended
