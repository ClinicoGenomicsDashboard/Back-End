DONOR: Related donors for recipients who have monogenetic mutations must be unaffected; for recipients with de novo mutations, testing of related donors is largely not required, but is recommended in all cases and is required when the donor is the child of the recipient; mutation testing needs to be performed by a CLIA-certified lab, if such testing is available; for donors who carry one mutated allele of a PID which is inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked fashion, the donor must have no discernable symptomatology or penetrance of the mutation suggesting that they are affected carriers; this should be verified through disease-appropriate quantitative and functional assays to assess the function of the potential donor’s immune system (e.g. whole blood EBV DNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], natural-killer group 2, member D [NKG2D] activity, T, B, and natural killer cells [TBNK] panel, and quantitative immunoglobulin levels for a female carrier of the magnesium transporter 1 [MAGT1] mutation that causes X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia [XMEN]); furthermore, the X-chromosome inactivation pattern should be assessed for female carriers of X-linked diseases if they are considered as potential donors to confirm favorable and complete lyonization of hematopoietic cells; for PIDs inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, donors who have one mutated allele for the recipient’s disease will be considered ineligible to donate, regardless of the donor’s phenotype; additional blood tests may be required to assess for quantitative and/or qualitative defects in the donor’s immune system, particularly in cases where PID mutation testing is not available or the PID mutation is not identified\r\n* A NIAID protocol (07-I-0033, Detection and Characterization of Infections and Infection Susceptibility, PI: Steve Holland) is already in place and will handle all the genetic/genomic analysis for recipients and potential donors on this protocol, including the management of results, genetic counseling, and education

PART 2: Comorbidity Index < 5 at the time of pre-transplant evaluation
DONOR: Umbilical cord blood units will be selected according to the following umbilical cord blood graft selection criteria; one or 2 cord blood (CB) units may be used to achieve the required cell dose
DONOR: Selection of two CB units is allowed to provide sufficient cell dose (see below for algorithm to determine single versus double unit transplant); when multiple units are selected, the following rules apply:\r\n* The CB unit with the least HLA disparity (with the patient) will be selected first (i.e., selection priority is 6/6 match > 5/6 match > 4/6 match); additional CB units then may be selected to achieve the required cell dose, as outlined below; if a second unit is required, this unit will be the unit that most closely HLA matches the patient and meets minimum size criteria outlined below of at least 1.5 x 10^7 total nucleated cells (TNC)/kg (i.e. a smaller, more closely matched unit will be selected over a larger, less well matched unit as long as minimum criteria are met)\r\n* If two CB units are used:\r\n** The total cell dose of the combined units must be at least 3.0 x 10^7 TNC per kilogram recipient weight\r\n** Each CB unit MUST contain at least 1.5 x 10^7 TNC per kilogram recipient weight\r\n* Algorithm for determining single versus double unit cord blood transplant:\r\n** Match grade 6/6: TNC dose >= 2.5 x 10^7/kg\r\n** Match grade 5/6, 4/6: TNC dose >= 4.0 (+/- 0.5) x 10^7/kg
DONOR: General comments:\r\n* Units will be selected first based on the TNC dose and HLA matching\r\n* Cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cell dose will not be used for unit selection unless 2 units of equal HLA-match grade and similar TNC dose (+/- 0.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg) are available; in this case, the unit with the larger CD34+ cell dose (if data available) should be selected\r\n* A CB unit that is 5/6 mismatched but homozygous at the locus of mismatch should be chosen over a 5/6 unit with bidirectional mismatch even if the latter unit is larger (has more cells); this also applies to 4/6 units; this is only applicable to choosing units within a given match grade\r\n* Other factors to be considered: \r\n** Within the same HLA match grade, matching at DR takes preference\r\n** Cord blood banks located in the United States are preferred\r\n* Up to 5% of the cord blood product(s), when ready for infusion, may be withheld for research purposes as long as thresholds for infused TNC dose are met; these products will be used to conduct studies involving the kinetics of engraftment and immunobiology of double cord transplantation

ENTRY CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: a caregiver can be anyone age 21 or over who is able to understand spoken English and understand the study process and provide informed consent; one caregiver for each patient will be eligible and must be chosen by the patient; for the purposes of this study, a caregiver is defined as a valued and trusted person in a patient’s life who is supportive in health care matters by providing valuable social support and/or direct assistive care; the caregiver accompanies the patient to medical appointments, is able to listen and give thoughtful advice and may be a family member, partner, friend, or professional caregiver
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: selected by the patient when asked if there is a “family member, partner, friend or caregiver (age 21 or older) with whom you discuss or who can be helpful in health-related matters”; patients who cannot identify such a person (“caregiver”) can be eligible for the study; a caregiver need not be someone who lives with the patient or provides direct hands-on care; a caregiver can be any person who provides support (in any way) to the patient
INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: if a health care proxy signs consent for or with a patient, and wants to participate in the caregiver portion of the study, this same person will always be the caregiver selected; if a health care proxy does not want to enroll as a caregiver in the study or, if enrolled, chooses to stop their own participation in the caregiver portion of the study, but is able to assist the patient in completing the study, the patient can still participate; in other words, the health care proxy can choose NOT to participate in the caregiver portion of the study; this does not preclude the patient from participating in the patient portion of the study with the health care proxy’s assistance
EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: caregivers unable to understand the consent form due to cognitive, health, or sensory impairment will be excluded
Must have a willing unrelated adult donor (bone marrow or peripheral blood); donors may have a single mismatch (i.e. be a 7/8) and this mismatch may be at the allele or antigen level; however, donors with allele level disparity should be given preference over those with antigen level disparity; the use of mismatched donors in which disparity is only in the host versus graft direction (because of recipient homozygosity) is discouraged because of the potentially heightened risk for graft rejection; centers may perform extended typing (e.g. DQB1 and DPB1) according to institutional practices and use these results in selecting donors; however, it is recommended that this extending typing be used only to select between donors who are equally well matched with the recipient at the A, B, C and DRB1

Prior use of an HPV vaccine  \r\n* Women in the vaccine-eligible age range cannot have received vaccine prior to enrollment, but will be offered HPV vaccination at the end of the study; in brief, we are interested in the efficacy of intervention in preventing HPV in the absence of HPV vaccination, since most women worldwide who might utilize intervention will not have been vaccinated; this includes United States (US) women in the vaccine “catch-up” 19-26 year old age group (beyond the age groups eligible for Vaccines for Children- funded vaccination) who have so far had very low (< 10%) vaccine uptake; it also includes the entire group of US women > 26 years of age; moreover, it includes women of all ages in developing countries, who most need an HPV prevention strategy, but may never be vaccinated; it should be noted that delaying vaccination in women 19-26 years of age by one year is safe and reasonable, since there is insufficient data to establish a recommendation for or against universal vaccination in this age group as concluded by an American Cancer Society expert panel, which includes the Principal Investigator (PI) of this protocol, Dr. Mark Einstein; it is anticipated that if the intervention gel is efficacious, HPV vaccinated women would need to be studied in a similar future trial with power analysis taking into account vaccine effectiveness as well

CRITERIA FOR PLASMA GENOTYPING
Tissue must be available for genotyping or biopsy planned to obtain tissue for genotyping; biopsy requirement may be waived if not technically feasible and plasma genotyping reveals an eligible EGFR mutation (exon 19 del/L858R); determination of technical feasibility must be made independently of plasma genotyping results
Participants must possess at least two of the following clinical characteristics which enrich for EGFR mutations:\r\n* Smoked less than 10 pack years\r\n* Asian race\r\n* Adenocarcinoma (including adenosquamous carcinoma) on histology or cytology
CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic window (including, but not limited to, alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus).
In France, a subject will not be eligible when under legal protection.
Primary ocular or mucosal melanoma.
Active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of herpetic infection (eg, herpetic keratitis or encephalitis).
Subject who is unwilling to minimize exposure with his/her blood or other body fluids to individuals who are at higher risks for HSV-1 induced complications (immunosuppressed individuals, HIV-positive individuals, pregnant women, or children under the age of 1 year) during talimogene laherparepvec treatment and through 28 days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec.
No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone or anti-epileptic drugs.
Placement of certain intrauterine devices (IUD) or intrauterine systems (IUS)
Hysterectomy, or vasectomy of the partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success) In addition, the use of condoms for patients or their partners is required
BPDCN

Follicular variant
Hurthle cell
Insular

Women without histologic confirmation of nodal involvement
Active collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a creatine kinase (CPK) level above normal or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosus, or scleroderma
Women must have newly diagnosed histologically confirmed ER positive (+) DCIS scheduled to undergo surgical therapy; the pathology report (signed pathology report from attending pathologist) from each individual institution will be used to determine eligibility\r\n* Note: After the patient has completed the study and the slides have been sent to Northwestern University (NU), our pathologists will review the slides to confirm the diagnosis\r\n* Note: DCIS suspicious for micro invasion is eligible on core biopsy
DCIS must be >= 5 mm of DCIS on one single core; can be < 5 mm if DCIS is identified on multiple cores (at least 2 cores)
Women presenting after excision with positive margins are eligible; Ki-67, cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (P-16), expression in immediately adjacent tissue is similar to what is found in DCIS\r\n* Note: Positive margins are defined as DCIS present at the inked margin or DCIS < 1 mm from the margin
Current hormone replacement therapy (HRT), selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or aromatase inhibitor (AI) use; if yes, the wash-out period is 30 days before diagnostic core needle biopsy\r\n* Note: local therapy (i.e. estrogen cream) will be permitted due to low systemic absorption of estrogen\r\n* Note: if patient is registered prior to completed washout, diagnostic core needle biopsy date will need to be provided
Unexplained/undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding (concern for undiagnosed endometrial cancer)
Has completed or scheduled to begin 4-6 cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy that does not include a taxane\r\n* Induction may contain, but is not required to contain bevacizumab or cetuximab; induction with a platinum doublet plus another biologic agent will be allowed following review by the University of North Carolina (UNC) principal investigator (PI) that there is no additional risk to the subject\r\n* Day 1 (D1) of treatment on LCCC1516 must be 21-42 days from the last day of induction, consistent with timing of standard of care maintenance
Had inadequate home environment or social support to safely complete the trial procedures
